&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;richlowe&amp;gt; blah.
&amp;lt;richlowe&amp;gt; that's what I say.
&amp;lt;pabs&amp;gt; if i say it too then what happens?
&amp;lt;richlowe&amp;gt; then &quot;that's what we say&quot;
&amp;lt;richlowe&amp;gt; duh.
&amp;lt;pabs&amp;gt; what if i say it, then retract it?
&amp;lt;richlowe&amp;gt; Did they teach you nothing in school!
&amp;lt;richlowe&amp;gt; &quot;that's what I say, and he said&quot;
&amp;lt;pabs&amp;gt; :(
&amp;lt;pabs&amp;gt; okay what if i say it, retract it, but then plan on saying it
       again at some point in the indeterminite future?
&amp;lt;richlowe&amp;gt; &quot;that's what I say, and he has said, and will possibly say
           again&quot;?
&amp;lt;pabs&amp;gt; see now that's not concise at all
&lt;/pre&gt;

Perhaps &lt;a href='http://www.dash-dash.org/pix/death.jpg'&gt;the image&lt;/a&gt;
on &lt;a href='http://www.dash-dash.org/'&gt;his site&lt;/a&gt; was a bit more
fitting than we realized.  I'm frustrated that nothing and noone around
him could help ease the pain that he was going through.  We can take
comfort in knowing that he felt the decision he made was best for him.
We'll miss you, Michael.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horis, Isis, Osiris, Oh My!

I started reading one of the several mythology books I checked out
earlier this week (as part of a personal research project, the results
of which will be available here eventually).  I've only made it through
about 60 pages of Egyptian mythology so far, but it's interesting stuff.
One thing that's impressive to me is how the sexes appear to be on much
more equal footing (as compared to the Judeo/Christian mythology we've
been innundated with for most of our lives).  For example, Isis revives
her husband Osiris by collecting his body parts, which are scattered
throughout Egypt.  She also saves her son Horus from death and nurtures
him until he can fend for himself.  Really interesting stuff.  Anyway,
I'll have more about the project as I get farther along.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href='http://www.linuxbrit.co.uk/'&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; has been having a rough
couple of weeks.  Apparently he's got &lt;a
href='http://www.ninds.nih.gov/health_and_medical/disorders/bells_doc.htm'&gt;Bell's
Palsy&lt;/a&gt; (link from ljlane), which, while treatable and rarely
permanent, still leaves his face partially paralyzed.  If you have a few
minutes, you might consider sending him an &lt;abbr title='Electronic
Card'&gt;E-Card&lt;/abbr&gt; or an &lt;a
href='mailto:dr_spock@linuxbrit.co.uk'&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

Ed got married in the Bahamas!  Here's a picture from the honeymoon:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(Fortunately he doesn't read this site).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One other thing.  I weigh 186&lt;abbr title='Pounds'&gt;lbs&lt;/abbr&gt; now.
The &lt;a href='http://www.pablotron.org/weight/'&gt;weight page&lt;/a&gt; has been
updated.

    <title>Weekend Update, sans Norm McDonald

&lt;p&gt;
What a nutty weekend.  A friend of mine went to the &lt;acronym
title='Emergency Room'&gt;ER&lt;/acronym&gt; on Friday night, so I spent 4 hours
down there.  It's really frustrating to see that many sick and injured
people in once place, and not really be able to do anything about it.
Also, for that much chaos, both the atmosphere and the staff are
disturbingly calm.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I finally got &lt;a href='http://www.raggle.org/'&gt;Raggle&lt;/a&gt; to a point
worthy of a new release.  I'm not going to blather on about the new
stuff; if you're interested you can &lt;a
href='http://www.raggle.org/'&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt; on your own.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href='http://www.pablotron.org/weight/'&gt;The war against obesity&lt;/a&gt;
continues!  I'm down to 188 pounds now, a total of 75 pounds lost since
the beginning of March.  I've been having trouble losing these last 10
pounds, so this week is officially &quot;Go to the Gym Every Night or Else&quot;
week.  2 days down, 5 to go.
&lt;/p&gt;
