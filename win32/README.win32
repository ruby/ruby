= How to build ruby using Visual C++

== Requirement

1.  Windows 7 or later.

2.  Visual C++ 12.0 (2013) or later.

    [Note] if you want to build x64 version, use native compiler for
           x64.

3.  Please set environment variable +INCLUDE+, +LIB+, +PATH+
    to run required commands properly from the command line.

    [Note] building ruby requires following commands.
    * nmake
    * cl
    * ml
    * lib
    * dumpbin

4.  If you want to build from GIT source, following commands are required.
    * bison
    * patch
    * sed
    * ruby 2.0 or later

5.  Enable Command Extension of your command line.  It's the default behavior
    of +cmd.exe+.  If you want to enable it explicitly, run +cmd.exe+ with
    <tt>/E:ON</tt> option.

== How to compile and install

1.  Execute <tt>win32\configure.bat</tt> on your build directory.
    You can specify the target platform as an argument.
    For example, run `<tt>configure --target=i686-mswin32</tt>'
    You can also specify the install directory.
    For example, run `<tt>configure --prefix=<install_directory></tt>'
    Default of the install directory is <tt>/usr</tt> .
    The default _PLATFORM_ is `+i386-mswin32_+_MSRTVERSION_' on 32-bit
    platforms, or `+x64-mswin64_+_MSRTVERSION_' on x64 platforms.
    _MSRTVERSION_ is the 2- or 3-digits version of the Microsoft
    Runtime Library.

2.  Change _RUBY_INSTALL_NAME_ and _RUBY_SO_NAME_ in +Makefile+
    if you want to change the name of the executable files.
    And add _RUBYW_INSTALL_NAME_ to change the name of the
    executable without console window if also you want.

3.  Run `<tt>nmake up</tt>' if you are building from GIT source.

4.  Run `<tt>nmake</tt>'

5.  Run `<tt>nmake check</tt>'

6.  Run `<tt>nmake install</tt>'

== Icons

Any icon files(*.ico) in the build directory, directories specified with
_icondirs_ make variable and +win32+ directory under the ruby
source directory will be included in DLL or executable files, according
to their base names.
    $(RUBY_INSTALL_NAME).ico or ruby.ico   --> $(RUBY_INSTALL_NAME).exe
    $(RUBYW_INSTALL_NAME).ico or rubyw.ico --> $(RUBYW_INSTALL_NAME).exe
    the others                             --> $(RUBY_SO_NAME).dll

Although no icons are distributed with the ruby source, you can use
anything you like. You will be able to find many images by search engines.
For example, followings are made from {Ruby logo
kit}[https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/misc/logo/ruby-logo-kit.zip]:

* Small {favicon}[https://www.ruby-lang.org/favicon.ico] in the official
  site

* http://ruby.morphball.net/vit-ruby-ico_en.html or
  {icon itself}[http://ruby.morphball.net/icon/vit-ruby.ico]

== Build examples

* Build on the ruby source directory.

  ex.)
    ruby source directory:  C:\ruby
    build directory:        C:\ruby
    install directory:      C:\usr\local

    C:
    cd \ruby
    win32\configure --prefix=/usr/local
    nmake
    nmake check
    nmake install

* Build on the relative directory from the ruby source directory.

  ex.)
    ruby source directory:  C:\ruby
    build directory:        C:\ruby\mswin32
    install directory:      C:\usr\local

    C:
    cd \ruby
    mkdir mswin32
    cd mswin32
    ..\win32\configure --prefix=/usr/local
    nmake
    nmake check
    nmake install

* Build on the different drive.

  ex.)
    ruby source directory:  C:\src\ruby
    build directory:        D:\build\ruby
    install directory:      C:\usr\local

    D:
    cd D:\build\ruby
    C:\src\ruby\win32\configure --prefix=/usr/local
    nmake
    nmake check
    nmake install DESTDIR=C:

* Build x64 version (requires native x64 VC++ compiler)

  ex.)
    ruby source directory:  C:\ruby
    build directory:        C:\ruby
    install directory:      C:\usr\local

    C:
    cd \ruby
    win32\configure --prefix=/usr/local --target=x64-mswin64
    nmake
    nmake check
    nmake install

== Bugs

You can *NOT* use a path name that contains any white space characters as
the ruby source directory, this restriction comes from the behavior of
<code>!INCLUDE</code> directives of +NMAKE+.

You can build ruby in any directory including the source directory,
except +win32+ directory in the source directory.
This is restriction originating in the path search method of +NMAKE+.
