/**
 * Passing  this  flag to  rb_nogvl()  prevents  it from  checking  interrupts.
 * Interrupts  can  impact  your  program negatively.   For  instance  consider
 * following callback function:
 *
 * ```CXX
 * static inline int fd; // set elsewhere.
 * static inline auto callback(auto buf) {
 *   auto tmp = ruby_xmalloc(BUFSIZ);
 *   auto ret = ruby_xmalloc(sizeof(ssize_t));  // (a)
 *   auto n = read(fd, tmp, BUFSIZ);            // (b)
 *   memcpy(buf, tmp, n);                       // (c)
 *   memcpy(ret, n, sizeof(n));
 *   ruby_xfree(tmp);
 *   return ret;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Here, if it gets interrupted at (a)  or (b), `read(2)` is cancelled and this
 * function leaks memory (which is not a good thing of course, but...).  But if
 * it gets interrupted at (c), where `read(2)` is already done, interruption is
 * way more catastrophic because what was read gets lost.  To reroute this kind
 * of problem you should set this flag.  And check interrupts elsewhere at your
 * own risk.

 *                 not   raise,   by   properly   rescuing   everything   using

 *                 raising exceptions from  any of the functions  passed to it.
 *                 If that  is dead necessary use  rb_thread_call_with_gvl() to
 *                 re-acquire the GVL.
 * @warning        In short, this API is difficult.  @ko1 recommends you to use
 *                 other ways if any.  We lack experiences to use this API.  If
 *                 you  find any  corner cases  etc., please  report it  to the
 *                 devs.
 * @warning        Releasing and re-acquiring the GVL are expensive operations.
 *                 For a short-running `func`, it  might be faster to just call
 *                 `func` with blocking everything  else.  Be sure to benchmark
 *                 your code to see if it is actually worth releasing the GVL.
