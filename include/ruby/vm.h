/**
 * ruby_vm_at_exit registers a function _func_ to be invoked when a VM
 * passed away.  Functions registered this way runs in reverse order
 * of registration, just like END {} block does.  The difference is
 * its timing to be triggered. ruby_vm_at_exit functions runs when a
 * VM _passed_ _away_, while END {} blocks runs just _before_ a VM
 * _is_ _passing_ _away_.
 *
 * You cannot register a function to another VM than where you are in.
 * So where to register is intuitive, omitted.  OTOH the argument
 * _func_ cannot know which VM it is in because at the time of
 * invocation, the VM has already died and there is no execution
 * context.  The VM itself is passed as the first argument to it.
 *
 * @param[in] func the function to register.
