 * is a new empty string:
 *
 * ```ruby
 * ''.succ # => ""
 * ```
 *
 * Otherwise  the successor  is  calculated by  "incrementing" characters.  The
 * first character to  be incremented is the rightmost alphanumeric:  or, if no

 *
 * ```ruby
 * 'THX1138'.succ # => "THX1139"
 * '<<koala>>'.succ # => "<<koalb>>"
 * '***'.succ # => '**+'
 * ```
 *
 * The  successor to  a digit  is another  digit, "carrying"  to the  next-left
 * character for  a "rollover"  from 9  to 0, and  prepending another  digit if
 * necessary:
 *
 * ```ruby
 * '00'.succ # => "01"
 * '09'.succ # => "10"
 * '99'.succ # => "100"
 * '-9'.succ # => "-10"
 * ```
 *
 * The successor to  a letter is another  letter of the same  case, carrying to
 * the next-left  character for  a rollover,  and prepending  another same-case
 * letter if necessary:
 *
 * ```ruby
 * 'aa'.succ # => "ab"
 * 'az'.succ # => "ba"
 * 'zz'.succ # => "aaa"
 * 'AA'.succ # => "AB"
 * 'AZ'.succ # => "BA"
 * 'ZZ'.succ # => "AAA"
 * ```
 *
 * The successor to  a non-alphanumeric character is the next  character in the
 * underlying  character set's  collating sequence,  carrying to  the next-left
 * character for a rollover, and prepending another character if necessary:
 *
 * ```ruby
 * s = "\u03A1"
 * s.succ # => "\u03A3"  # There is no such thing like \u03A2.
 * s = 255.chr * 3
 * s # => "\xFF\xFF\xFF"
 * s.succ # => "\x01\x00\x00\x00"
 * ```
 *

 *
 * ```ruby
 * s = 'zz99zz99'
 * s.succ # => "aaa00aa00"
 * s = '99zz99zz'
 * s.succ # => "100aa00aa"
