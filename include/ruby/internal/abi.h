/* This number represents Ruby's ABI version.
 *
 * In development Ruby, it should be bumped every time an ABI incompatible
 * change is introduced. This will force other developers to rebuild extension
 * gems.
 *
 * The following cases are considered as ABI incompatible changes:
 * - Changing any data structures.
 * - Changing macros or inline functions causing a change in behavior.
 * - Deprecating or removing function declarations.
 *
 * The following cases are NOT considered as ABI incompatible changes:
 * - Any changes that does not involve the header files in the `include`
 *   directory.
 * - Adding macros, inline functions, or function declarations.
 * - Backwards compatible refactors.
 * - Editing comments.
 *
 * In released versions of Ruby, this number is not defined since teeny
 * versions of Ruby should guarantee ABI compatibility.
