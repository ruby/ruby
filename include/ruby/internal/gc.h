 * Maybe this  is the only  function provided for  C extensions to  control the

 * can move  around the object space.   Our GC engine rearranges  these objects
 * after it  reclaims unreachable objects  from our  object space, so  that the
 * space  is   compact  (improves  memory   locality).   This  is   called  the
 * "compaction" phase, and works  well most of the time... as  far as there are
 * no C  extensions.  C  extensions complicate the  scenario because  Ruby core
 * cannot detect  any use  of the  physical address  of an  object inside  of C
 * functions.  In order to prevent  memory corruptions, objects observable from
 * C extensions are "pinned"; they stick to where they are born until they die,
 * just in  case any C  extensions touch their  raw pointers.  This  variant of
 * scheme  is   called  "Mostly-Copying"  garbage  collector.    Authors  of  C
 * extensions,  however,   can  extremely   carefully  write  them   to  become
 * compaction-aware.  To do so avoid referring  to a Ruby object from inside of
 * your struct  in the  first place.   But if  that is  not possible,  use this
 * function  from your  ::rb_data_type_struct::dmark  then.   This way  objects
 * marked using it are  considered movable.  If you chose this  way you have to
 * manually fix up locations of such moved pointers using rb_gc_location().
