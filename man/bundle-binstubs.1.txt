1mNAME0m
       1mbundle-binstubs 22m- Install the binstubs of the listed gems

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mbundle binstubs 4m22mGEM_NAME24m [--force] [--path PATH] [--standalone]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       Binstubs  are  scripts  that wrap around executables. Bundler creates a
       small Ruby file (a binstub) that loads Bundler, runs the  command,  and
       puts  it  into  1mbin/22m. Binstubs are a shortcut-or alternative- to always
       using 1mbundle exec22m. This gives you a file that can by run directly,	and
       one  that  will always run the correct gem version used by the applica-
       tion.

       For example, if you run 1mbundle binstubs rspec-core22m, Bundler will create
       the file 1mbin/rspec22m. That file will contain enough code to load Bundler,
       tell it to load the bundled gems, and then run rspec.

       This command generates binstubs for executables in  1mGEM_NAME22m.  Binstubs
       are  put into 1mbin22m, or the 1m--path 22mdirectory if one has been set. Calling
       binstubs with [GEM [GEM]] will create binstubs for all given gems.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m--force0m
	      Overwrite existing binstubs if they exist.

       1m--path 22mThe location to install the specified binstubs to. This defaults

       1m--standalone0m
	      Makes  binstubs  that  can work without depending on Rubygems or
	      Bundler at runtime.

       1m--shebang0m
	      Specify a different shebang executable  name  than  the  default
	      (default 'ruby')
