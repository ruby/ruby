NAME
       bundle-pristine - Restores installed gems to their pristine condition

SYNOPSIS
       bundle pristine

DESCRIPTION
       pristine  restores  the	installed gems in the bundle to their pristine
       condition using the local gem cache from  RubyGems.  For  git  gems,  a
       forced checkout will be performed.

       For  further  explanation,  bundle  pristine  ignores unpacked files on
       disk. In other words, this command utilizes the local .gem cache or the
       gem's git repository as if one were installing from scratch.

       Note:  the  Bundler  gem  cannot be restored to its original state with
       pristine. One also cannot use bundle pristine on  gems  with  a	'path'
       option  in  the	Gemfile,  because  bundler has no original copy it can
       restore from.

       When is it practical to use bundle pristine?

       It comes in handy when a developer is debugging a gem. bundle  pristine
       is a great way to get rid of experimental changes to a gem that one may
       not want.

       Why use bundle pristine over gem pristine --all?

       Both commands are very similar. For context: bundle  pristine,  without
       arguments,  cleans  all gems from the lockfile. Meanwhile, gem pristine
       --all cleans all installed gems for that Ruby version.

       If a developer forgets which gems in their project they might have been
       debugging,  the Rubygems gem pristine [GEMNAME] command may be inconve-
       nient. One can avoid waiting for gem pristine --all,  and  instead  run
       bundle pristine.
