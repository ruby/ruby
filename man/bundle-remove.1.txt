SYNOPSIS
       bundle remove [GEM [GEM ...]] [--install]

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the  given  gems  from  the  Gemfile  while  ensuring that the
       resulting Gemfile is still valid. If a gem cannot be removed, a warning
       is  printed.  If a gem is already absent from the Gemfile, and error is
       raised.

OPTIONS
       --install
              Runs bundle install after the given gems have been removed  from
              the  Gemfile,  which  ensures  that  both  the  lockfile and the
              installed gems on disk are also  updated  to  remove  the  given
              gem(s).

       Example:

       bundle remove rails

       bundle remove rails rack

       bundle remove rails rack --install
