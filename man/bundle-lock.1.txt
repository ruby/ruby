	      tion of that platform.

	      --patch | --minor | --major.

       1m--conservative0m
	      If updating, use bundle install conservative update behavior and
	      do not allow shared dependencies to be updated.

1mUPDATING ALL GEMS0m
       If  you	run  1mbundle  lock  22mwith  1m--update 22moption without list of gems,
       bundler will ignore any	previously  installed  gems  and  resolve  all
       dependencies  again  based on the latest versions of all gems available
       in the sources.

1mUPDATING A LIST OF GEMS0m
       Sometimes, you want to update a single gem in the Gemfile(5), and leave
       the  rest  of the gems that you specified locked to the versions in the
       1mGemfile.lock22m.

       For instance, you  only	want  to  update  1mnokogiri22m,  run  1mbundle  lock0m
       1m--update nokogiri22m.

       Bundler will update 1mnokogiri 22mand any of its dependencies, but leave the
       rest of the gems that you specified locked to the versions in the  1mGem-0m
       1mfile.lock22m.

1mSUPPORTING OTHER PLATFORMS0m
       If  you want your bundle to support platforms other than the one you're
       running locally, you can run 1mbundle lock --add-platform PLATFORM 22mto add
       PLATFORM  to the lockfile, force bundler to re-resolve and consider the
       new platform when picking gems, all without needing to have  a  machine
       that matches PLATFORM handy to install those platform-specific gems on.

       For a full explanation of gem platforms, see 1mgem help platform22m.

1mPATCH LEVEL OPTIONS0m
       See bundle update(1) 4mbundle-update.1.html24m for details.
