SYNOPSIS
       bundle	 lock	[--update]   [--local]	 [--print]   [--lockfile=PATH]
       [--full-index] [--add-platform] [--remove-platform] [--patch] [--minor]
       [--major] [--strict] [--conservative]

DESCRIPTION
       Lock the gems specified in Gemfile.

OPTIONS
       --update=<*gems>
	      Ignores  the  existing  lockfile. Resolve then updates lockfile.
	      Taking a list of gems or updating all gems if no list is	given.

       --local
	      Do not attempt to connect to rubygems.org. Instead, Bundler will
	      use the gems already present  in	Rubygems'  cache  or  in  ven-
	      dor/cache.  Note	that  if  a  appropriate platform-specific gem
	      exists on rubygems.org it will not be found.

       --print
	      Prints the lockfile to STDOUT instead of	writing  to  the  file
	      system.

       --lockfile=<path>
	      The path where the lockfile should be written to.

       --full-index
	      Fall back to using the single-file index of all gems.

       --add-platform
	      Add  a  new platform to the lockfile, re-resolving for the addi-
	      tion of that platform.

       --remove-platform
	      Remove a platform from the lockfile.

       --patch
	      If updating, prefer updating only to next patch version.

       --minor
	      If updating, prefer updating only to next minor version.

       --major
	      If updating, prefer updating to next major version (default).

       --strict
	      If updating, do not allow any gem  to  be  updated  past	latest
	      --patch | --minor | --major.

       --conservative
	      If updating, use bundle install conservative update behavior and
	      do not allow shared dependencies to be updated.

UPDATING ALL GEMS
       If you run bundle lock with  --update  option  without  list  of  gems,
       bundler	will  ignore  any  previously  installed  gems and resolve all
       dependencies again based on the latest versions of all  gems  available
       in the sources.

UPDATING A LIST OF GEMS
       Sometimes, you want to update a single gem in the Gemfile(5), and leave
       the rest of the gems that you specified locked to the versions  in  the
       Gemfile.lock.

       For  instance,  you  only  want	to  update  nokogiri,  run bundle lock
       --update nokogiri.

       Bundler will update nokogiri and any of its dependencies, but leave the
       rest  of the gems that you specified locked to the versions in the Gem-
       file.lock.

SUPPORTING OTHER PLATFORMS
       If you want your bundle to support platforms other than the one	you're
       running locally, you can run bundle lock --add-platform PLATFORM to add
       PLATFORM to the lockfile, force bundler to re-resolve and consider  the
       new  platform  when picking gems, all without needing to have a machine
       that matches PLATFORM handy to install those platform-specific gems on.

       For a full explanation of gem platforms, see gem help platform.

PATCH LEVEL OPTIONS
       See bundle update(1) bundle-update.1.html for details.
