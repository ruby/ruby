       1mbundle-platform 22m- Displays platform compatibility information

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mbundle platform 22m[--ruby]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mplatform  22mwill display information from your Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, and
       Ruby VM about your platform.

       For instance, using this Gemfile(5):



	   source "https://rubygems.org"

	   ruby "1.9.3"

	   gem "rack"



       If you run 1mbundle platform 22mon Ruby 1.9.3, it will display the following
       output:



	   Your platform is: x86_64-linux

	   Your app has gems that work on these platforms:
	   * ruby

	   Your Gemfile specifies a Ruby version requirement:
	   * ruby 1.9.3

	   Your current platform satisfies the Ruby version requirement.



       1mplatform  22mwill  list  all the platforms in your 1mGemfile.lock 22mas well as
       the 1mruby 22mdirective if applicable from your Gemfile(5). It will also let
       you know if the 1mruby 22mdirective requirement has been met. If 1mruby 22mdirec-
       tive doesn't match the running Ruby VM, it will tell you what part does
       not.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m--ruby 22mIt  will  display  the  ruby directive information, so you don't
	      have to parse it from the Gemfile(5).
