NAME
       bundle-platform - Displays platform compatibility information

SYNOPSIS
       bundle platform [--ruby]

DESCRIPTION
       platform  will display information from your Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, and
       Ruby VM about your platform.

       For instance, using this Gemfile(5):



	   source "https://rubygems.org"

	   ruby "1.9.3"

	   gem "rack"



       If you run bundle platform on Ruby 1.9.3, it will display the following
       output:



	   Your platform is: x86_64-linux

	   Your app has gems that work on these platforms:
	   * ruby

	   Your Gemfile specifies a Ruby version requirement:
	   * ruby 1.9.3

	   Your current platform satisfies the Ruby version requirement.



       platform  will  list  all the platforms in your Gemfile.lock as well as
       the ruby directive if applicable from your Gemfile(5). It will also let
       you know if the ruby directive requirement has been met. If ruby direc-
       tive doesn't match the running Ruby VM, it will tell you what part does
       not.

OPTIONS
       --ruby It  will	display  the  ruby directive information, so you don't
	      have to parse it from the Gemfile(5).
