.
.SH "NAME"
\fBbundle\-outdated\fR \- List installed gems with newer versions available
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbundle outdated\fR [GEM] [\-\-local] [\-\-pre] [\-\-source] [\-\-strict] [\-\-parseable | \-\-porcelain] [\-\-group=GROUP] [\-\-groups] [\-\-update\-strict] [\-\-patch|\-\-minor|\-\-major] [\-\-filter\-major] [\-\-filter\-minor] [\-\-filter\-patch] [\-\-only\-explicit]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Outdated lists the names and versions of gems that have a newer version available in the given source\. Calling outdated with [GEM [GEM]] will only check for newer versions of the given gems\. Prerelease gems are ignored by default\. If your gems are up to date, Bundler will exit with a status of 0\. Otherwise, it will exit 1\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-\-local\fR
Do not attempt to fetch gems remotely and use the gem cache instead\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-pre\fR
Check for newer pre\-release gems\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-source\fR
Check against a specific source\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-strict\fR
Only list newer versions allowed by your Gemfile requirements\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-parseable\fR, \fB\-\-porcelain\fR
Use minimal formatting for more parseable output\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-group\fR
List gems from a specific group\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-groups\fR
List gems organized by groups\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-update\-strict\fR
Strict conservative resolution, do not allow any gem to be updated past latest \-\-patch | \-\-minor| \-\-major\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-minor\fR
Prefer updating only to next minor version\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-major\fR
Prefer updating to next major version (default)\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-patch\fR
Prefer updating only to next patch version\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-filter\-major\fR
Only list major newer versions\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-filter\-minor\fR
Only list minor newer versions\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-filter\-patch\fR
Only list patch newer versions\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-only\-explicit\fR
Only list gems specified in your Gemfile, not their dependencies\.
.
.SH "PATCH LEVEL OPTIONS"
See bundle update(1) \fIbundle\-update\.1\.html\fR for details\.
.
.P
One difference between the patch level options in \fBbundle update\fR and here is the \fB\-\-strict\fR option\. \fB\-\-strict\fR was already an option on outdated before the patch level options were added\. \fB\-\-strict\fR wasn\'t altered, and the \fB\-\-update\-strict\fR option on \fBoutdated\fR reflects what \fB\-\-strict\fR does on \fBbundle update\fR\.
.
.SH "FILTERING OUTPUT"
The 3 filtering options do not affect the resolution of versions, merely what versions are shown in the output\.
.
.P
If the regular output shows the following:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

* faker (newest 1\.6\.6, installed 1\.6\.5, requested ~> 1\.4) in groups "development, test"
* hashie (newest 3\.4\.6, installed 1\.2\.0, requested = 1\.2\.0) in groups "default"
* headless (newest 2\.3\.1, installed 2\.2\.3) in groups "test"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
\fB\-\-filter\-major\fR would only show:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

* hashie (newest 3\.4\.6, installed 1\.2\.0, requested = 1\.2\.0) in groups "default"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
\fB\-\-filter\-minor\fR would only show:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

* headless (newest 2\.3\.1, installed 2\.2\.3) in groups "test"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
\fB\-\-filter\-patch\fR would only show:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

* faker (newest 1\.6\.6, installed 1\.6\.5, requested ~> 1\.4) in groups "development, test"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Filter options can be combined\. \fB\-\-filter\-minor\fR and \fB\-\-filter\-patch\fR would show:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

* faker (newest 1\.6\.6, installed 1\.6\.5, requested ~> 1\.4) in groups "development, test"
* headless (newest 2\.3\.1, installed 2\.2\.3) in groups "test"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Combining all three \fBfilter\fR options would be the same result as providing none of them\.
