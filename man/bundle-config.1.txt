NAME
       bundle-config - Set bundler configuration options

SYNOPSIS
       bundle config [list|get|set|unset] [name [value]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  allows you to interact with Bundler's configuration sys-
       tem.

       Bundler loads configuration settings in this order:

       1.  Local config (app/.bundle/config)

       2.  Environmental variables (ENV)

       3.  Global config (~/.bundle/config)

       4.  Bundler default config



       Executing bundle config list with will print a list of all bundler con-
       figuration  for	the  current  bundle, and where that configuration was
       set.

       Executing bundle config get <name> will print the value of that config-
       uration setting, and where it was set.

       Executing  bundle config set <name> <value> will set that configuration
       to the value specified for all bundles executed as  the	current  user.
       The  configuration  will be stored in ~/.bundle/config. If name already
       is set, name will be overridden and user will be warned.

       Executing bundle config set --global <name> <value> works the  same  as
       above.

       Executing  bundle  config set --local <name> <value> will set that con-
       figuration to the local application. The configuration will  be	stored
       in app/.bundle/config.

       Executing  bundle  config unset <name> will delete the configuration in
       both local and global sources.

       Executing bundle config unset --global <name> will delete the  configu-
       ration only from the user configuration.

       Executing  bundle  config  unset --local <name> <value> will delete the
       configuration only from the local application.

       Executing bundle with the BUNDLE_IGNORE_CONFIG environment variable set
       will cause it to ignore all configuration.

       Executing bundle config set disable_multisource true upgrades the warn-
       ing about the Gemfile containing multiple primary sources to an	error.
       Executing bundle config unset disable_multisource downgrades this error
       to a warning.

REMEMBERING OPTIONS
       Flags passed to bundle install or the Bundler runtime, such  as	--path
       foo  or	--without  production, are not remembered between commands. If
       these options must be remembered, they must be set using bundle	config
       (e.g., bundle config set path foo).

       The options that can be configured are:

       bin    Creates  a  directory (defaults to ~/bin) and place any executa-
	      bles from the gem there. These executables run in Bundler's con-
	      text.  If  used,	you  might add this directory to your environ-
	      ment's PATH variable. For instance, if the rails gem comes  with
	      a rails executable, this flag will create a bin/rails executable
	      that ensures that all referred  dependencies  will  be  resolved
	      using the bundled gems.

       deployment
	      In  deployment mode, Bundler will 'roll-out' the bundle for pro-
	      duction use. Please check carefully if you  want	to  have  this
	      option enabled in development or test environments.

       path   The  location to install the specified gems to. This defaults to
	      Rubygems' setting. Bundler shares this location  with  Rubygems,
	      gem  install  ... will have gem installed there, too. Therefore,
	      gems installed without a --path ...  setting  will  show	up  by
	      calling gem list. Accordingly, gems installed to other locations
	      will not get listed.

       without
	      A space-separated list of groups referencing gems to skip during
	      installation.

       with   A  space-separated  list	of  groups referencing gems to include
	      during installation.

BUILD OPTIONS
       You can use bundle config to give Bundler the flags to pass to the  gem
       installer every time bundler tries to install a particular gem.

       A  very	common	example, the mysql gem, requires Snow Leopard users to
       pass configuration flags to gem install to specify where  to  find  the
       mysql_config executable.



	   gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config



       Since  the specific location of that executable can change from machine
       to machine, you can specify these flags on a per-machine basis.



	   bundle config set build.mysql --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config



       After running this command, every time bundler  needs  to  install  the
       mysql gem, it will pass along the flags you specified.

CONFIGURATION KEYS
       Configuration  keys  in	bundler have two forms: the canonical form and
       the environment variable form.

       For instance, passing the --without  flag  to  bundle  install(1)  bun-
       dle-install.1.html  prevents  Bundler  from  installing	certain groups
       specified in the Gemfile(5). Bundler persists this value  in  app/.bun-
       dle/config  so that calls to Bundler.setup do not try to find gems from
       the Gemfile that you didn't install. Additionally, subsequent calls  to
       bundle  install(1) bundle-install.1.html remember this setting and skip
       those groups.

       The canonical form of this configuration is "without". To  convert  the
       canonical  form	to  the  environment variable form, capitalize it, and
       prepend BUNDLE_. The environment variable form  of  "without"  is  BUN-
       DLE_WITHOUT.

       Any  periods in the configuration keys must be replaced with two under-
       scores when setting it via environment variables. The configuration key
       local.rack becomes the environment variable BUNDLE_LOCAL__RACK.

	   use as the Gemfile. This location of this file also sets  the  root
	   of the project, which is used to resolve relative paths in the Gem-
	   file, among other things. By default, bundler will search  up  from
	   the current working directory until it finds a Gemfile.

       o   global_gem_cache  (BUNDLE_GLOBAL_GEM_CACHE): Whether Bundler should
	   cache all gems globally, rather than locally to the installing Ruby

	   SIONS): During bundle update, only resolve to newer versions of the
	   gems in the lockfile.

       o   path (BUNDLE_PATH): The location on disk where  all	gems  in  your
	   bundle will be located regardless of $GEM_HOME or $GEM_PATH values.
	   Bundle gems not found in this location will be installed by	bundle
	   install.  Defaults  to Gem.dir. When --deployment is used, defaults
	   to vendor/bundle.

       o   path.system (BUNDLE_PATH__SYSTEM):  Whether	Bundler  will  install
	   gems into the default system path (Gem.dir).

       o   path_relative_to_cwd   (BUNDLE_PATH_RELATIVE_TO_CWD)  Makes	--path

	   tem.

       o   prefer_gems_rb  (BUNDLE_PREFER_GEMS_RB)  Prefer  gems.rb to Gemfile
	   when Bundler is searching for a Gemfile.

       o   prefer_patch (BUNDLE_PREFER_PATCH): Prefer updating	only  to  next
	   patch  version during updates. Makes bundle update calls equivalent
	   to bundler update --patch.

       o   print_only_version_number (BUNDLE_PRINT_ONLY_VERSION_NUMBER)  Print
	   only version number from bundler --version.

       o   redirect  (BUNDLE_REDIRECT):  The  number  of redirects allowed for
	   network requests. Defaults to 5.

       o   retry (BUNDLE_RETRY): The number of times to retry  failed  network
	   requests. Defaults to 3.

	   LIC): Have Bundler.setup make the Kernel#gem  method  public,  even
	   though RubyGems declares it as private.

       o   shebang  (BUNDLE_SHEBANG):  The program name that should be invoked
	   for generated binstubs. Defaults to the ruby install name  used  to
	   generate the binstub.

       o   silence_deprecations (BUNDLE_SILENCE_DEPRECATIONS): Whether Bundler
	   should silence deprecation  warnings  for  behavior	that  will  be
	   changed in the next major version.

	   warning Bundler prints when installing gems as root.

       o   skip_default_git_sources (BUNDLE_SKIP_DEFAULT_GIT_SOURCES): Whether
	   Bundler should skip adding default git source shortcuts to the Gem-
	   file DSL.

       o   specific_platform  (BUNDLE_SPECIFIC_PLATFORM):  Allow  bundler   to
	   resolve for the specific running platform and store it in the lock-
	   file, instead of only using a generic platform. A specific platform
	   is  the exact platform triple reported by Gem::Platform.local, such
	   as x86_64-darwin-16	or  universal-java-1.8.  On  the  other  hand,
	   generic  platforms  are those such as ruby, mswin, or java. In this
	   example, x86_64-darwin-16 would map to ruby and  universal-java-1.8
	   to java.

       o   ssl_ca_cert	(BUNDLE_SSL_CA_CERT): Path to a designated CA certifi-
	   cate file or folder containing multiple  certificates  for  trusted
	   CAs in PEM format.

	   containing a X.509 client certificate and key in PEM format.

       o   ssl_verify_mode (BUNDLE_SSL_VERIFY_MODE): The SSL verification mode
	   Bundler uses when making HTTPS requests. Defaults to verify peer.

       o   suppress_install_using_messages (BUNDLE_SUPPRESS_INSTALL_USING_MES-
	   SAGES): Avoid printing Using ... messages during installation  when
	   the version of a gem has not changed.

       o   system_bindir  (BUNDLE_SYSTEM_BINDIR):  The location where RubyGems
	   installs binstubs. Defaults to Gem.bindir.

       o   timeout (BUNDLE_TIMEOUT): The seconds allowed before timing out for
	   network requests. Defaults to 10.

       o   unlock_source_unlocks_spec	  (BUNDLE_UNLOCK_SOURCE_UNLOCKS_SPEC):
	   Whether running bundle update --source NAME unlocks a gem with  the
	   given name. Defaults to true.

       o   update_requires_all_flag  (BUNDLE_UPDATE_REQUIRES_ALL_FLAG) Require
	   passing --all to bundle update when everything should  be  updated,
	   and disallow passing no options to bundle update.

       o   user_agent  (BUNDLE_USER_AGENT):  The  custom  user	agent fragment
	   Bundler includes in API requests.

       o   with (BUNDLE_WITH): A :-separated list of groups whose gems bundler
	   should install.

       o   without  (BUNDLE_WITHOUT):  A :-separated list of groups whose gems
	   bundler should not install.



       In general, you should set these settings per-application by using  the
       applicable  flag to the bundle install(1) bundle-install.1.html or bun-
       dle package(1) bundle-package.1.html command.

       You can set them globally either via environment  variables  or	bundle
       config,	whichever is preferable for your setup. If you use both, envi-
       ronment variables will take preference over global settings.

LOCAL GIT REPOS
       Bundler also allows you	to  work  against  a  git  repository  locally
       instead of using the remote version. This can be achieved by setting up
       a local override:



	   bundle config set local.GEM_NAME /path/to/local/git/repository



       For example, in order to use a local Rack repository, a developer could
       call:



	   bundle config set local.rack ~/Work/git/rack



       Now  instead of checking out the remote git repository, the local over-
       ride will be used. Similar to a path source, every time the  local  git
       repository  change, changes will be automatically picked up by Bundler.
       This means a commit in the local git repo will update the  revision  in
       the Gemfile.lock to the local git repo revision. This requires the same
       attention as git submodules. Before pushing to the remote, you need  to
       ensure the local override was pushed, otherwise you may point to a com-
       mit that only exists in your local machine. You'll  also  need  to  CGI
       escape your usernames and passwords as well.

       Bundler	does many checks to ensure a developer won't work with invalid
       references. Particularly, we force a developer to specify a  branch  in
       the  Gemfile  in  order to use this feature. If the branch specified in
       the Gemfile and the current branch in the local git repository  do  not
       match,  Bundler	will  abort.  This  ensures that a developer is always
       working against the correct branches, and prevents  accidental  locking
       to a different branch.

       Finally,  Bundler  also	ensures  that the current revision in the Gem-
       file.lock exists in the local git repository. By  doing	this,  Bundler
       forces you to fetch the latest changes in the remotes.

MIRRORS OF GEM SOURCES
       Bundler	supports  overriding gem sources with mirrors. This allows you
       to configure rubygems.org as the gem source in your Gemfile while still
       using your mirror to fetch gems.



	   bundle config set mirror.SOURCE_URL MIRROR_URL



       For  example,  to  use a mirror of rubygems.org hosted at rubygems-mir-
       ror.org:



	   bundle config set mirror.http://rubygems.org http://rubygems-mirror.org



       Each mirror also provides a fallback timeout  setting.  If  the	mirror
       does  not  respond within the fallback timeout, Bundler will try to use
       the original server instead of the mirror.



	   bundle config set mirror.SOURCE_URL.fallback_timeout TIMEOUT



       For example, to fall back to rubygems.org after 3 seconds:



	   bundle config set mirror.https://rubygems.org.fallback_timeout 3



       The default fallback timeout is 0.1 seconds, but the setting  can  cur-
       rently only accept whole seconds (for example, 1, 15, or 30).

CREDENTIALS FOR GEM SOURCES
       Bundler	allows	you to configure credentials for any gem source, which
       allows you to avoid putting secrets into your Gemfile.



	   bundle config set SOURCE_HOSTNAME USERNAME:PASSWORD



       For example, to save the credentials of	user  claudette  for  the  gem
       source at gems.longerous.com, you would run:



	   bundle config set gems.longerous.com claudette:s00pers3krit



       Or you can set the credentials as an environment variable like this:



	   export BUNDLE_GEMS__LONGEROUS__COM="claudette:s00pers3krit"



       For gems with a git source with HTTP(S) URL you can specify credentials
       like so:



	   bundle config set https://github.com/bundler/bundler.git username:password



       Or you can set the credentials as an environment variable like so:



	   export BUNDLE_GITHUB__COM=username:password



       This is especially useful for private repositories  on  hosts  such  as
       Github, where you can use personal OAuth tokens:



	   export BUNDLE_GITHUB__COM=abcd0123generatedtoken:x-oauth-basic



CONFIGURE BUNDLER DIRECTORIES
       Bundler's  home,  config,  cache  and plugin directories are able to be
       configured through environment  variables.  The	default  location  for
       Bundler's  home	directory  is ~/.bundle, which all directories inherit
       from by default. The following outlines the available environment vari-
       ables and their default values



	   BUNDLE_USER_HOME : $HOME/.bundle
	   BUNDLE_USER_CACHE : $BUNDLE_USER_HOME/cache
	   BUNDLE_USER_CONFIG : $BUNDLE_USER_HOME/config
	   BUNDLE_USER_PLUGIN : $BUNDLE_USER_HOME/plugin
