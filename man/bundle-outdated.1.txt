NAME
       bundle-outdated - List installed gems with newer versions available

SYNOPSIS
       bundle	outdated   [GEM]   [--local]   [--pre]	[--source]  [--strict]
       [--parseable	|     --porcelain]     [--group=GROUP]	    [--groups]
       [--update-strict]  [--patch|--minor|--major]  [--filter-major]  [--fil-
       ter-minor] [--filter-patch] [--only-explicit]

DESCRIPTION
       Outdated lists the names and versions of gems that have a newer version
       available  in  the given source. Calling outdated with [GEM [GEM]] will
       only check for newer versions of the given gems.  Prerelease  gems  are
       ignored by default. If your gems are up to date, Bundler will exit with
       a status of 0. Otherwise, it will exit 1.

OPTIONS
       --local
	      Do not attempt to fetch gems remotely  and  use  the  gem  cache
	      instead.

       --pre  Check for newer pre-release gems.

       --source
	      Check against a specific source.

       --strict
	      Only list newer versions allowed by your Gemfile requirements.

       --parseable, --porcelain
	      Use minimal formatting for more parseable output.

       --group
	      List gems from a specific group.

       --groups
	      List gems organized by groups.

       --update-strict
	      Strict  conservative  resolution,  do  not  allow  any gem to be
	      updated past latest --patch | --minor| --major.

       --minor
	      Prefer updating only to next minor version.

       --major
	      Prefer updating to next major version (default).

       --patch
	      Prefer updating only to next patch version.

       --filter-major
	      Only list major newer versions.

       --filter-minor
	      Only list minor newer versions.

       --filter-patch
	      Only list patch newer versions.

       --only-explicit
	      Only list gems specified in your Gemfile,  not  their  dependen-
	      cies.

PATCH LEVEL OPTIONS
       See bundle update(1) bundle-update.1.html for details.

       One  difference	between  the  patch level options in bundle update and
       here is the --strict option. --strict was already an option on outdated
       before the patch level options were added. --strict wasn't altered, and
       the --update-strict option on outdated reflects what --strict  does  on
       bundle update.

FILTERING OUTPUT
       The  3  filtering  options  do  not  affect the resolution of versions,
       merely what versions are shown in the output.

       If the regular output shows the following:



	   * faker (newest 1.6.6, installed 1.6.5, requested ~> 1.4) in groups "development, test"
	   * hashie (newest 3.4.6, installed 1.2.0, requested = 1.2.0) in groups "default"
	   * headless (newest 2.3.1, installed 2.2.3) in groups "test"



       --filter-major would only show:



	   * hashie (newest 3.4.6, installed 1.2.0, requested = 1.2.0) in groups "default"



       --filter-minor would only show:



	   * headless (newest 2.3.1, installed 2.2.3) in groups "test"



       --filter-patch would only show:



	   * faker (newest 1.6.6, installed 1.6.5, requested ~> 1.4) in groups "development, test"



       Filter options can be combined. --filter-minor and --filter-patch would
       show:



	   * faker (newest 1.6.6, installed 1.6.5, requested ~> 1.4) in groups "development, test"
	   * headless (newest 2.3.1, installed 2.2.3) in groups "test"



       Combining  all three filter options would be the same result as provid-
       ing none of them.
