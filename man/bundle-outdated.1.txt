       1mbundle   outdated   22m[GEM]	[--local]   [--pre]  [--source]  [--strict]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       Outdated lists the names and versions of gems that have a newer version
       available  in  the given source. Calling outdated with [GEM [GEM]] will
       only check for newer versions of the given gems.  Prerelease  gems  are
       ignored by default. If your gems are up to date, Bundler will exit with
       a status of 0. Otherwise, it will exit 1.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m--local0m
	      Do not attempt to fetch gems remotely  and  use  the  gem  cache
	      instead.

       1m--pre	22mCheck for newer pre-release gems.

       1m--source0m
	      Check against a specific source.

       1m--parseable22m, 1m--porcelain0m
	      Use minimal formatting for more parseable output.

       1m--group0m
	      List gems from a specific group.

       1m--groups0m
	      List gems organized by groups.

       1m--update-strict0m
	      Strict  conservative  resolution,  do  not  allow  any gem to be
	      updated past latest --patch | --minor| --major.

       1m--minor0m

1mPATCH LEVEL OPTIONS0m
       See bundle update(1) 4mbundle-update.1.html24m for details.

       One  difference	between  the  patch level options in 1mbundle update 22mand
       here is the 1m--strict 22moption. 1m--strict 22mwas already an option on outdated
       before the patch level options were added. 1m--strict 22mwasn't altered, and
       the 1m--update-strict 22moption on 1moutdated 22mreflects what 1m--strict  22mdoes  on
       1mbundle update22m.

1mFILTERING OUTPUT0m
       The  3  filtering  options  do  not  affect the resolution of versions,
       merely what versions are shown in the output.

       If the regular output shows the following:



	   * faker (newest 1.6.6, installed 1.6.5, requested ~> 1.4) in groups "development, test"
	   * hashie (newest 3.4.6, installed 1.2.0, requested = 1.2.0) in groups "default"
	   * headless (newest 2.3.1, installed 2.2.3) in groups "test"



       1m--filter-major 22mwould only show:



	   * hashie (newest 3.4.6, installed 1.2.0, requested = 1.2.0) in groups "default"



       1m--filter-minor 22mwould only show:



	   * headless (newest 2.3.1, installed 2.2.3) in groups "test"



       1m--filter-patch 22mwould only show:



	   * faker (newest 1.6.6, installed 1.6.5, requested ~> 1.4) in groups "development, test"



       Filter options can be combined. 1m--filter-minor 22mand 1m--filter-patch 22mwould
       show:



	   * faker (newest 1.6.6, installed 1.6.5, requested ~> 1.4) in groups "development, test"
	   * headless (newest 2.3.1, installed 2.2.3) in groups "test"



       Combining  all three 1mfilter 22moptions would be the same result as provid-
       ing none of them.
