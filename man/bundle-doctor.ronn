bundle-doctor(1) -- Checks the bundle for common problems
=========================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`bundle doctor` [--quiet]
                [--gemfile=GEMFILE]

## DESCRIPTION

Checks your Gemfile and gem environment for common problems. If issues
are detected, Bundler prints them and exits status 1. Otherwise,
Bundler prints a success message and exits status 0.

Examples of common problems caught by bundle-doctor include:

* Invalid Bundler settings
* Mismatched Ruby versions
* Mismatched platforms
* Uninstalled gems
* Missing dependencies

## OPTIONS

* `--quiet`:
  Only output warnings and errors.

* `--gemfile=<gemfile>`:
  The location of the Gemfile(5) which Bundler should use. This defaults
  to a Gemfile(5) in the current working directory. In general, Bundler
  will assume that the location of the Gemfile(5) is also the project's
  root and will try to find `Gemfile.lock` and `vendor/cache` relative
  to this location.
