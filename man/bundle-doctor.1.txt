1mDESCRIPTION0m
       Checks  your Gemfile and gem environment for common problems. If issues
       are detected, Bundler  prints  them  and  exits	status	1.  Otherwise,
       Bundler prints a success message and exits status 0.

       Examples of common problems caught by bundle-doctor include:

       o   Invalid Bundler settings

       o   Mismatched Ruby versions

       o   Mismatched platforms

       o   Uninstalled gems

	      The  location  of  the Gemfile(5) which Bundler should use. This
	      defaults to a Gemfile(5) in the current  working	directory.  In
	      general, Bundler will assume that the location of the Gemfile(5)
	      is also the project's root and will try to find 1mGemfile.lock 22mand
	      1mvendor/cache 22mrelative to this location.
