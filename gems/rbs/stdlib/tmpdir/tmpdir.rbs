  # the permission to make the temporary directory accessible from other users.

  # The prefix and suffix of the name of the directory is specified by the
  # optional first argument, *prefix_suffix*.
  # *   If it is not specified or nil, "d" is used as the prefix and no suffix is
  #     used.
  # *   If it is a string, it is used as the prefix and no suffix is used.
  # *   If it is an array, first element is used as the prefix and second element
  #     is used as a suffix.
