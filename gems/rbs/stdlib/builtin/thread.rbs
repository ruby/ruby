# Threads are the Ruby implementation for a concurrent programming model.
# 
# Programs that require multiple threads of execution are a perfect
# candidate for Ruby's [Thread](Thread) class.
# 
# For example, we can create a new thread separate from the main thread's
# execution using [::new](Thread#method-c-new).
# 
# ```ruby
# thr = Thread.new { puts "Whats the big deal" }
# ```
# 
# Then we are able to pause the execution of the main thread and allow our
# new thread to finish, using
# [join](Thread#method-i-join):
# 
# ```ruby
# thr.join #=> "Whats the big deal"
# ```
# 
# If we don't call `thr.join` before the main thread terminates, then all
# other threads including `thr` will be killed.
# 
# Alternatively, you can use an array for handling multiple threads at
# once, like in the following example:
# 
# ```ruby
# threads = []
# threads << Thread.new { puts "Whats the big deal" }
# threads << Thread.new { 3.times { puts "Threads are fun!" } }
# ```
# 
# After creating a few threads we wait for them all to finish
# consecutively.
# 
# ```ruby
# threads.each { |thr| thr.join }
# ```
# 
# 
# In order to create new threads, Ruby provides
# [::new](Thread#method-c-new),
# [::start](Thread#method-c-start), and
# [::fork](Thread#method-c-fork). A block must be
# provided with each of these methods, otherwise a
# [ThreadError](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/ThreadError.html) will be
# raised.
# 
# When subclassing the [Thread](Thread) class, the
# `initialize` method of your subclass will be ignored by
# [::start](Thread#method-c-start) and
# [::fork](Thread#method-c-fork). Otherwise, be sure
# to call super in your `initialize` method.
# 
# 
# For terminating threads, Ruby provides a variety of ways to do this.
# 
# The class method [::kill](Thread#method-c-kill), is
# meant to exit a given thread:
# 
#     thr = Thread.new { ... }
#     Thread.kill(thr) # sends exit() to thr
# 
# Alternatively, you can use the instance method
# [exit](Thread#method-i-exit), or any of its aliases
# [kill](Thread#method-i-kill) or
# [terminate](Thread#method-i-terminate).
# 
# ```ruby
# thr.exit
# ```
# 
# 
# Ruby provides a few instance methods for querying the state of a given
# thread. To get a string with the current thread's state use
# [status](Thread#method-i-status)
# 
# ```ruby
# thr = Thread.new { sleep }
# thr.status # => "sleep"
# thr.exit
# thr.status # => false
# ```
# 
# You can also use [alive?](Thread#method-i-alive-3F)
# to tell if the thread is running or sleeping, and
# [stop?](Thread#method-i-stop-3F) if the thread is
# dead or sleeping.
# 
# 
# Since threads are created with blocks, the same rules apply to other
# Ruby blocks for variable scope. Any local variables created within this
# block are accessible to only this thread.
# 
# 
# Each fiber has its own bucket for
# [\#\[\]](Thread#method-i-5B-5D) storage. When you
# set a new fiber-local it is only accessible within this
# [Fiber](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Fiber.html). To illustrate:
# 
# ```ruby
# Thread.new {
#   Thread.current[:foo] = "bar"
#   Fiber.new {
#     p Thread.current[:foo] # => nil
#   }.resume
# }.join
# ```
# 
# This example uses [\[\]](Thread#method-i-5B-5D) for
# getting and [\[\]=](Thread#method-i-5B-5D-3D) for
# setting fiber-locals, you can also use
# [keys](Thread#method-i-keys) to list the
# fiber-locals for a given thread and
# [key?](Thread#method-i-key-3F) to check if a
# fiber-local exists.
# 
# When it comes to thread-locals, they are accessible within the entire
# scope of the thread. Given the following example:
# 
# ```ruby
# Thread.new{
#   Thread.current.thread_variable_set(:foo, 1)
#   p Thread.current.thread_variable_get(:foo) # => 1
#   Fiber.new{
#     Thread.current.thread_variable_set(:foo, 2)
#     p Thread.current.thread_variable_get(:foo) # => 2
#   }.resume
#   p Thread.current.thread_variable_get(:foo)   # => 2
# }.join
# ```
# 
# You can see that the thread-local `:foo` carried over into the fiber and
# was changed to `2` by the end of the thread.
# 
# This example makes use of
# [thread\_variable\_set](Thread#method-i-thread_variable_set)
# to create new thread-locals, and
# [thread\_variable\_get](Thread#method-i-thread_variable_get)
# to reference them.
# 
# There is also
# [thread\_variables](Thread#method-i-thread_variables)
# to list all thread-locals, and
# [thread\_variable?](Thread#method-i-thread_variable-3F)
# to check if a given thread-local exists.
# 
# 
# Any thread can raise an exception using the
# [raise](Thread#method-i-raise) instance method,
# which operates similarly to
# [Kernel\#raise](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Kernel.html#method-i-raise)
# .
# 
# However, it's important to note that an exception that occurs in any
# thread except the main thread depends on
# [abort\_on\_exception](Thread#method-i-abort_on_exception)
# . This option is `false` by default, meaning that any unhandled
# exception will cause the thread to terminate silently when waited on by
# either [join](Thread#method-i-join) or
# [value](Thread#method-i-value). You can change this
# default by either
# [abort\_on\_exception=](Thread#method-i-abort_on_exception-3D)
# `true` or setting $DEBUG to `true` .
# 
# With the addition of the class method
# [::handle\_interrupt](Thread#method-c-handle_interrupt)
# , you can now handle exceptions asynchronously with threads.
# 
# 
# Ruby provides a few ways to support scheduling threads in your program.
# 
# The first way is by using the class method
# [::stop](Thread#method-c-stop), to put the current
# running thread to sleep and schedule the execution of another thread.
# 
# Once a thread is asleep, you can use the instance method
# [wakeup](Thread#method-i-wakeup) to mark your thread
# as eligible for scheduling.
# 
# You can also try [::pass](Thread#method-c-pass),
# which attempts to pass execution to another thread but is dependent on
# the OS whether a running thread will switch or not. The same goes for
# [priority](Thread#method-i-priority), which lets
# you hint to the thread scheduler which threads you want to take
# precedence when passing execution. This method is also dependent on the
# OS and may be ignored on some platforms.

  # Changes asynchronous interrupt timing.

  # [\#kill](Thread.downloaded.ruby_doc#method-i-kill), signal trap (not
  # supported yet) and main thread termination (if main thread terminates,

  # 
  # The given `hash` has pairs like `ExceptionClass => :TimingSymbol` .
  # Where the ExceptionClass is the interrupt handled by the given block.
  # The TimingSymbol can be one of the following symbols:
  # 
  #   - `:immediate`
  #     Invoke interrupts immediately.
  # 
  #   - `:on_blocking`
  #     Invoke interrupts while *BlockingOperation* .
  # 
  #   - `:never`
  #     Never invoke all interrupts.
  # 
  # *BlockingOperation* means that the operation will block the calling
  # thread, such as read and write. On CRuby implementation,
  # *BlockingOperation* is any operation executed without GVL.
  # 
  # Masked asynchronous interrupts are delayed until they are enabled. This
  # method is similar to sigprocmask(3).
  # 
  # 
  # Asynchronous interrupts are difficult to use.
  # 
  # If you need to communicate between threads, please consider to use
  # another way such as [Queue](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Queue.html)
  # .
  # 
  # Or use them with deep understanding about this method.
  # 
  # 
  # In this example, we can guard from
  # [\#raise](Thread.downloaded.ruby_doc#method-i-raise) exceptions.
  # 
  # Using the `:never` TimingSymbol the
  # [RuntimeError](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/RuntimeError.html)
  # exception will always be ignored in the first block of the main thread.
  # In the second

  # exceptions.
  # 
  # ```ruby
  # th = Thread.new do
  #   Thread.handle_interrupt(RuntimeError => :never) {
  #     begin
  #       # You can write resource allocation code safely.
  #       Thread.handle_interrupt(RuntimeError => :immediate) {
  #         # ...
  #       }
  #     ensure
  #       # You can write resource deallocation code safely.
  #     end
  #   }
  # end
  # Thread.pass
  # # ...
  # th.raise "stop"
  # ```
  # 
  # While we are ignoring the
  # [RuntimeError](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/RuntimeError.html)
  # exception, it’s safe to write our resource allocation code. Then, the
  # ensure block is where we can safely deallocate your resources.
  # 
  # 
  # In the next example, we will guard from the Timeout::Error exception.
  # This will help prevent from leaking resources when Timeout::Error
  # exceptions occur during normal ensure clause. For this example we use
  # the help of the standard library Timeout, from lib/timeout.rb
  # 
  # ```ruby
  # require 'timeout'
  # Thread.handle_interrupt(Timeout::Error => :never) {
  #   timeout(10){
  #     # Timeout::Error doesn't occur here
  #     Thread.handle_interrupt(Timeout::Error => :on_blocking) {
  #       # possible to be killed by Timeout::Error
  #       # while blocking operation
  #     }
  #     # Timeout::Error doesn't occur here
  #   }
  # }
  # ```
  # 
  # In the first part of the `timeout` block, we can rely on Timeout::Error
  # being ignored. Then in the `Timeout::Error => :on_blocking` block, any
  # operation that will block the calling thread is susceptible to a
  # Timeout::Error exception being raised.
  # 
  # 
  # It’s possible to stack multiple levels of
  # [::handle\_interrupt](Thread.downloaded.ruby_doc#method-c-handle_interrupt)
  # blocks in order to control more than one ExceptionClass and TimingSymbol
  # at a time.
  # 
  # ```ruby
  # Thread.handle_interrupt(FooError => :never) {
  #   Thread.handle_interrupt(BarError => :never) {
  #      # FooError and BarError are prohibited.
  #   }
  # }
  # ```
  # 
  # 
  # All exceptions inherited from the ExceptionClass parameter will be
  # considered.
  # 
  # ```ruby
  # Thread.handle_interrupt(Exception => :never) {
  #   # all exceptions inherited from Exception are prohibited.
  # }

# The [Queue](Queue) class implements multi-producer,

# when information must be exchanged safely between multiple threads. The
# [Queue](Queue) class implements all the required

# 
# The class implements FIFO type of queue. In a FIFO queue, the first
# tasks added are the first retrieved.
# 
# Example:
# 
# ```ruby
# queue = Queue.new
# 
# producer = Thread.new do
#   5.times do |i|
#      sleep rand(i) # simulate expense
#      queue << i

#      value = queue.pop

  #   - when `empty?` is false, calling deq/pop/shift will return an object
