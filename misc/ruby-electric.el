;; ruby-electric.el --- electric editing commands for ruby files
;;
;; Copyright (C) 2005 by Dee Zsombor <dee dot zsombor at gmail dot com>.
;; Released under same license terms as Ruby.
;;
;; Due credit: this work was inspired by a code snippet posted by
;; Frederick Ros at http://rubygarden.org/ruby?EmacsExtensions.
;;
;; Following improvements where added:
;;
;;       - handling of strings of type 'here document'
;;       - more keywords, with special handling for 'do'
;;       - packaged into a minor mode
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;    0) copy ruby-electric.el into directory where emacs can find it.
;;
;;    1) modify your startup file (.emacs or whatever) by adding
;;       following line:
;;
;;            (require 'ruby-electric)
;;
;;       note that you need to have font lock enabled beforehand.
;;
;;    2) toggle Ruby Electric Mode on/off with ruby-electric-mode.
;;
;; Changelog:
;;
;;  2005/Jan/14: inserts matching pair delimiters like {, [, (, ', ",
;;  ' and | .
;;
;;  2005/Jan/14: added basic Custom support for configuring keywords
;;  with electric closing.
;;
;;  2005/Jan/18: more Custom support for configuring characters for
;;  which matching expansion should occur.
;;
;;  2005/Jan/18: no longer uses 'looking-back' or regexp character
;;  classes like [:space:] since they are not implemented on XEmacs.
;;
;;  2005/Feb/01: explicitly provide default argument of 1 to
;;  'backward-word' as it requires it on Emacs 21.3
;;
;;  2005/Mar/06: now stored inside ruby CVS; customize pages now have
;;  ruby as parent; cosmetic fixes.
