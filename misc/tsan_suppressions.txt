# TSan: ThreadSanitizer
# https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/threadsanitizersuppressions
#
# This file describes a number of places where TSAN detects problems in CRuby.
# Many of these indicate bugs. Others are benign (ex. data races that can be
# replaced with relaxed atomic loads)
#
# Usage:
#   Configure with:
#     ./configure cflags='-fsanitize=thread' CC=clang
#   Build and run with:
#     TSAN_OPTIONS="suppressions=$(pwd)/misc/tsan_suppressions.txt:die_after_fork=0"
#
# Other useful TSAN_OPTIONS:
#   * halt_on_error=1
#   * strip_path_prefix=$(pwd)/
