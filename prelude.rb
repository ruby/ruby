  # the underlying file descriptor.
  #
  # If the optional <i>outbuf</i> argument is present,
  # it must reference a String, which will receive the data.
  # The <i>outbuf</i> will contain only the received data after the method call
  # even if it is not empty at the beginning.
  #
  # read_nonblock just calls the read(2) system call.
  # It causes all errors the read(2) system call causes: Errno::EWOULDBLOCK, Errno::EINTR, etc.
  # The caller should care such errors.
  #
  # If the exception is Errno::EWOULDBLOCK or Errno::EAGAIN,
  # it is extended by IO::WaitReadable.
  # So IO::WaitReadable can be used to rescue the exceptions for retrying
  # read_nonblock.
  #
  # read_nonblock causes EOFError on EOF.
  #
  # If the read byte buffer is not empty,
  # read_nonblock reads from the buffer like readpartial.
  # In this case, the read(2) system call is not called.
  #
  # When read_nonblock raises an exception kind of IO::WaitReadable,
  # read_nonblock should not be called
  # until io is readable for avoiding busy loop.
  # This can be done as follows.
  #
  #   # emulates blocking read (readpartial).

  # Note that this method is identical to readpartial
  # except the non-blocking flag is set.
