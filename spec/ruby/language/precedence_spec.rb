# Specifying the behavior of operators in combination could
# lead to combinatorial explosion. A better way seems to be
# to use a technique from formal proofs that involve a set of
# equivalent statements. Suppose you have statements A, B, C.
# If they are claimed to be equivalent, this can be shown by
# proving that A implies B, B implies C, and C implies A.
# (Actually any closed circuit of implications.)
#
# Here, we can use a similar technique where we show starting
# at the top that each level of operator has precedence over
# the level below (as well as showing associativity within
# the precedence level).

Table 22.4. Ruby operators (high to low precedence)

* Operators marked with 'x' in the Method column are implemented as methods
and can be overridden (except != and !~ as noted). (But see the specs
below for implementations that define != and !~ as methods.)

** These are not included in the excerpted table but are shown here for
completeness.
