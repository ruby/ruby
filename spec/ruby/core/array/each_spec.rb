# Mutating the array while it is being iterated is discouraged as it can result in confusing behavior.
# Yet a Ruby implementation must not crash in such a case, and following the simple CRuby behavior makes sense.
# CRuby simply reads the array storage and checks the size for every iteration;
# like `i = 0; while i < size; yield self[i]; end`
