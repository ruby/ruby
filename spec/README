= RubySpec

RubySpec (http://rubyspec.org) provides the Ruby language specification in an
executable format. The make task `update-rubyspec' retrieves the specification
and puts it into this directory.

== Directory structure

       +-- fixtures    example classes for writing specs
       +-- language    specification for Ruby language itself
       +-- library     specification for standard libraries
            +-- addrev
