# NEWS for Ruby 3.2.0

This document is a list of user-visible feature changes
since the **3.1.0** release, except for bug fixes.

Note that each entry is kept to a minimum, see links for details.

## Language changes

* Anonymous rest and keyword rest arguments can now be passed as
  arguments, instead of just used in method parameters.
  [[Feature #18351]]

    ```ruby
    def foo(*)
      bar(*)
    end
    def baz(**)
      quux(**)
    end
    ```

* Constant assignment evaluation order for constants set on explicit
  objects has been made consistent with single attribute assignment
  evaluation order.  With this code:

    ```ruby
    foo::BAR = baz
    ```

  `foo` is now called before `baz`. Similarly, for multiple assignment
  to constants,  left-to-right evaluation order is used.  With this
  code:

    ```ruby
      foo1::BAR1, foo2::BAR2 = baz1, baz2
    ```

  The following evaluation order is now used:

  1. `foo1`
  2. `foo2`
  3. `baz1`
  4. `baz2`

  [[Bug #15928]]

## Command line options

## Core classes updates

Note: We're only listing outstanding class updates.

* Hash
    * Hash#shift now always returns nil if the hash is
      empty, instead of returning the default value or
      calling the default proc. [[Bug #16908]]

* Module
    * Module.used_refinements has been added. [[Feature #14332]]
    * Module#refinements has been added. [[Feature #12737]]
    * Module#const_added has been added. [[Feature #17881]]

* Proc
    * Proc#dup returns an instance of subclass. [[Bug #17545]]

* Refinement
    * Refinement#refined_class has been added. [[Feature #12737]]

* Set
    * Set is now available as a builtin class without the need for `require "set"`. [[Feature #16989]]
      It is currently autoloaded via the `Set` constant or a call to `Enumerable#to_set`.

* Struct
    * A Struct class can also be initialized with keyword arguments
      without `keyword_init: true` on `Struct.new` [[Feature #16806]]

    * RubyGems 3.4.0.dev
