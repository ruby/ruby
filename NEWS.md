# NEWS for Ruby 3.5.0

This document is a list of user-visible feature changes
since the **3.4.0** release, except for bug fixes.

Note that each entry is kept to a minimum, see links for details.

## Language changes

* `*nil` no longer calls `nil.to_a`, similar to how `**nil` does
  not call `nil.to_hash`.  [[Feature #21047]]

## Core classes updates

Note: We're only listing outstanding class updates.

* Binding

    * `Binding#local_variables` does no longer include numbered parameters.
      Also, `Binding#local_variable_get` and `Binding#local_variable_set` reject
      to handle numbered parameters.  [[Bug #21049]]

* IO

    * `IO.select` accepts +Float::INFINITY+ as a timeout argument.
      [[Feature #20610]]

* Ractor

    * `Ractor::Port` class was added for a new synchronization mechanism
      to communicate between Ractors. [[Feature #21262]]

        ```ruby
        port1 = Ractor::Port.new
        port2 = Ractor::Port.new
        Ractor.new port1, port2 do |port1, port2|
          port1 << 1
          port2 << 11
          port1 << 2
          port2 << 12
        end
        2.times{ p port1.receive } #=> 1, 2
        2.times{ p port2.receive } #=> 11, 12
        ```

        `Ractor::Port` provides the following methods:

        * `Ractor::Port#receive`
        * `Ractor::Port#send` (or `Ractor::Port#<<`)
        * `Ractor::Port#close`
        * `Ractor::Port#closed?`

        As result, `Ractor.yield` and `Ractor#take` were removed.

    * `Ractor#join` and `Ractor#value` were added to wait for the
      termination of a Ractor. These are similar to `Thread#join`
      and `Thread#value`.

    * `Ractor#monitor` and `Ractor#unmonitor` were added as low-level
      interfaces used internally to implement `Ractor#join`.

    * `Ractor.select` now only accepts Ractors and Ports. If Ractors are given,
      it returns when a Ractor terminates.

    * `Ractor#default_port` was added. Each `Ractor` has a default port,
      which is used by `Ractor.send`, `Ractor.receive`.

    * `Ractor#close_incoming` and `Ractor#close_outgoing` were removed.

* Set

    * Set is now a core class, instead of an autoloaded stdlib class.
      [[Feature #21216]]

* String

    * Update Unicode to Version 16.0.0 and Emoji Version 16.0.
      [[Feature #19908]][[Feature #20724]] (also applies to Regexp)

* Fiber::Scheduler

    * Introduce `Fiber::Scheduler#fiber_interrupt` to interrupt a fiber with a
      given exception. The initial use case is to interrupt a fiber that is
      waiting on a blocking IO operation when the IO operation is closed.
      [[Feature #21166]]

## Supported platforms

## Compatibility issues

* The following methdos were removed from Ractor due because of `Ractor::Port`:

    * `Ractor.yield`
    * `Ractor#take`
    * `Ractor#close_incoming`
    * `Ractor#close_outgoging`

    [[Feature #21262]]

## Stdlib compatibility issues

* CGI library is removed from the default gems. Now we only provide `cgi/escape` for
  the following methods:

    * `CGI.escape` and `CGI.unescape`
    * `CGI.escapeHTML` and `CGI.unescapeHTML`
    * `CGI.escapeURIComponent` and `CGI.unescapeURIComponent`
    * `CGI.escapeElement` and `CGI.unescapeElement`

    [[Feature #21258]]

* With the move of `Set` from stdlib to core class, `set/sorted_set.rb` has
  been removed, and `SortedSet` is no longer an autoloaded constant. Please
  install the `sorted_set` gem and `require 'sorted_set'` to use `SortedSet`.
  [[Feature #21287]]

## C API updates

* IO

    * `rb_thread_fd_close` is deprecated and now a no-op. If you need to expose
      file descriptors from C extensions to Ruby code, create an `IO` instance
      using `RUBY_IO_MODE_EXTERNAL` and use `rb_io_close(io)` to close it (this
      also interrupts and waits for all pending operations on the `IO`
      instance). Directly closing file descriptors does not interrupt pending
      operations, and may lead to undefined behaviour. In other words, if two
      `IO` objects share the same file descriptor, closing one does not affect
      the other. [[Feature #18455]]
