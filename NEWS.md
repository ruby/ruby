# NEWS for Ruby 3.5.0

This document is a list of user-visible feature changes
since the **3.4.0** release, except for bug fixes.

Note that each entry is kept to a minimum, see links for details.

## Language changes

* `*nil` no longer calls `nil.to_a`, similar to how `**nil` does
  not call `nil.to_hash`.  [[Feature #21047]]

## Core classes updates

Note: We're only listing outstanding class updates.

* Kernel

    * `Kernel#inspect` now checks for the existence of a `#instance_variables_to_inspect` method,
      allowing control over which instance variables are displayed in the `#inspect` string:

        ```ruby
        class DatabaseConfig
          def initialize(host, user, password)
            @host = host
            @user = user
            @password = password
          end

          private def instance_variables_to_inspect = [:@host, :@user]
        end

        conf = DatabaseConfig.new("localhost", "root", "hunter2")
        conf.inspect #=> #<DatabaseConfig:0x0000000104def350 @host="localhost", @user="root">
        ```

        [[Feature #21219]]

* Binding

    * `Binding#local_variables` does no longer include numbered parameters.
      Also, `Binding#local_variable_get` and `Binding#local_variable_set` reject
      to handle numbered parameters.  [[Bug #21049]]

* IO

    * `IO.select` accepts +Float::INFINITY+ as a timeout argument.
      [[Feature #20610]]

* Math

    * `Math.log1p` and `Math.expm1` are added. [[Feature #21527]]

* Socket

    * `Socket.tcp` & `TCPSocket.new` accepts `open_timeout` as a keyword argument to specify
      the timeout for the initial connection. [[Feature #21347]]

* Ractor

    * `Ractor::Port` class was added for a new synchronization mechanism
      to communicate between Ractors. [[Feature #21262]]

        ```ruby
        port1 = Ractor::Port.new
        port2 = Ractor::Port.new
        Ractor.new port1, port2 do |port1, port2|
          port1 << 1
          port2 << 11
          port1 << 2
          port2 << 12
        end
        2.times{ p port1.receive } #=> 1, 2
        2.times{ p port2.receive } #=> 11, 12
        ```

        `Ractor::Port` provides the following methods:

        * `Ractor::Port#receive`
        * `Ractor::Port#send` (or `Ractor::Port#<<`)
        * `Ractor::Port#close`
        * `Ractor::Port#closed?`

        As result, `Ractor.yield` and `Ractor#take` were removed.

    * `Ractor#join` and `Ractor#value` were added to wait for the
      termination of a Ractor. These are similar to `Thread#join`
      and `Thread#value`.

    * `Ractor#monitor` and `Ractor#unmonitor` were added as low-level
      interfaces used internally to implement `Ractor#join`.

    * `Ractor.select` now only accepts Ractors and Ports. If Ractors are given,
      it returns when a Ractor terminates.

    * `Ractor#default_port` was added. Each `Ractor` has a default port,
      which is used by `Ractor.send`, `Ractor.receive`.

    * `Ractor#close_incoming` and `Ractor#close_outgoing` were removed.

* Set

    * Set is now a core class, instead of an autoloaded stdlib class.
      [[Feature #21216]]

* String

    * Update Unicode to Version 16.0.0 and Emoji Version 16.0.
      [[Feature #19908]][[Feature #20724]] (also applies to Regexp)

* Thread

    * Introduce support for `Thread#raise(cause:)` argument similar to
      `Kernel#raise`. [[Feature #21360]]

* Fiber

    * Introduce support for `Fiber#raise(cause:)` argument similar to
      `Kernel#raise`. [[Feature #21360]]

* Fiber::Scheduler

    * Introduce `Fiber::Scheduler#fiber_interrupt` to interrupt a fiber with a
      given exception. The initial use case is to interrupt a fiber that is
      waiting on a blocking IO operation when the IO operation is closed.
      [[Feature #21166]]

* Pathname

    * Pathname has been promoted from a default gem to a core class of Ruby.
      [[Feature #17473]]

## Supported platforms

## Compatibility issues

* The following methods were removed from Ractor due because of `Ractor::Port`:

    * `Ractor.yield`
    * `Ractor#take`
    * `Ractor#close_incoming`
    * `Ractor#close_outgoging`

    [[Feature #21262]]

* `ObjectSpace._id2ref` is deprecated. [[Feature #15408]]

## Stdlib compatibility issues

* CGI library is removed from the default gems. Now we only provide `cgi/escape` for
  the following methods:

    * `CGI.escape` and `CGI.unescape`
    * `CGI.escapeHTML` and `CGI.unescapeHTML`
    * `CGI.escapeURIComponent` and `CGI.unescapeURIComponent`
    * `CGI.escapeElement` and `CGI.unescapeElement`

    [[Feature #21258]]

* With the move of `Set` from stdlib to core class, `set/sorted_set.rb` has
  been removed, and `SortedSet` is no longer an autoloaded constant. Please
  install the `sorted_set` gem and `require 'sorted_set'` to use `SortedSet`.
  [[Feature #21287]]

## C API updates

* IO

    * `rb_thread_fd_close` is deprecated and now a no-op. If you need to expose
      file descriptors from C extensions to Ruby code, create an `IO` instance
      using `RUBY_IO_MODE_EXTERNAL` and use `rb_io_close(io)` to close it (this
      also interrupts and waits for all pending operations on the `IO`
      instance). Directly closing file descriptors does not interrupt pending
      operations, and may lead to undefined behaviour. In other words, if two
      `IO` objects share the same file descriptor, closing one does not affect
      the other. [[Feature #18455]]

## Implementation improvements

## JIT

* YJIT
    * YJIT stats
        * `ratio_in_yjit` no longer works in the default build.
          Use `--enable-yjit=stats` on `configure` to enable it on `--yjit-stats`.
        * Add `invalidate_everything` to default stats, which is
          incremented when every code is invalidated by TracePoint.
    * Add `mem_size:` and `call_threshold:` options to `RubyVM::YJIT.enable`.
* ZJIT
    * Add an experimental method-based JIT compiler.
      Use `--enable-zjit` on `configure` to enable the `--zjit` support.
    * As of Ruby 3.5.0-preview2, ZJIT is not yet ready for speeding up most benchmarks.
      Please refrain from evaluating ZJIT just yet. Stay tuned for the Ruby 3.5 release.
* RJIT
    * `--rjit` is removed. We will move the implementation of the third-party JIT API
      to the [ruby/rjit](https://github.com/ruby/rjit) repository.
