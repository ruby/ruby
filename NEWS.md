# NEWS for Ruby 3.4.0

This document is a list of user-visible feature changes
since the **3.3.0** release, except for bug fixes.

Note that each entry is kept to a minimum, see links for details.

## Language changes

* String literals in files without a `frozen_string_literal` comment now behave
  as if they were frozen. If they are mutated a deprecation warning is emitted.
  These warnings can be enabled with `-W:deprecated` or by setting `Warning[:deprecated] = true`.
  To disable this change, you can run Ruby with the `--disable-frozen-string-literal`
  command line argument. [[Feature #20205]]

* `it` is added to reference a block parameter. [[Feature #18980]]

* Keyword splatting `nil` when calling methods is now supported.
  `**nil` is treated similarly to `**{}`, passing no keywords,
  and not calling any conversion methods.  [[Bug #20064]]

* Block passing is no longer allowed in index.  [[Bug #19918]]

* Keyword arguments are no longer allowed in index.  [[Bug #20218]]

## Core classes updates

Note: We're only listing outstanding class updates.

* Exception

  * Exception#set_backtrace now accepts arrays of `Thread::Backtrace::Location`.
    `Kernel#raise`, `Thread#raise` and `Fiber#raise` also accept this new format. [[Feature #13557]]

* Range

  * Range#size now raises TypeError if the range is not iterable. [[Misc #18984]]

## Supported platforms

## Compatibility issues

* Error messages and backtrace displays have been changed.
  * Use a single quote instead of a backtick as a opening quote. [[Feature #16495]]
  * Display a class name before a method name (only when the class has a permanent name). [[Feature #19117]]
  * `Kernel#caller`, `Thread::Backtrace::Location`'s methods, etc. are also changed accordingly.
  ```
  Old:
  test.rb:1:in `foo': undefined method `time' for an instance of Integer
          from test.rb:2:in `<main>'

  New:
  test.rb:1:in 'Object#foo': undefined method 'time' for an instance of Integer
          from test.rb:2:in `<main>'
  ```

## Stdlib compatibility issues

## C API updates

* `rb_newobj` and `rb_newobj_of` (and corresponding macros `RB_NEWOBJ`, `RB_NEWOBJ_OF`, `NEWOBJ`, `NEWOBJ_OF`) have been removed. [[Feature #20265]]
* Removed deprecated function `rb_gc_force_recycle`. [[Feature #18290]]

## Implementation improvements

* `Array#each` is rewritten in Ruby for better performance [[Feature #20182]].

## JIT

## Miscellaneous changes

* Passing a block to a method which doesn't use the passed block will show
  a warning on verbose mode (`-w`).
  [[Feature #15554]]

* Redefining some core methods that are specially optimized by the interpeter
  and JIT like `String.freeze` or `Integer#+` now emits a performance class
  warning (`-W:performance` or `Warning[:performance] = true`).
  [[Feature #20429]]
