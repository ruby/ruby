We think Ruby is the best programming language.

For internal issues we want our own programming language based on Ruby.

It will become a new naming of methods, which must be compatible with the original Ruby.

We will need destructors for the GC and another name for the GC.

And we want Ruby's old simplicity for the returned values:
a not assigned variable which is used does not raise an exception, it will return a nil object instead.

Our dream is this Ruby will become "Microsoft A++" for the .NET framework and ruby scripts will be translated to the CLI.

Actually we do not have the money to cooperate with Microsoft, so A++ will be even more custom and from Systemulate. Another thing is the conflict of the GPL with Microsoft.
