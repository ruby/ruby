    this.on "-I", "--srcdir=DIR", <<-'end'
      Historically this option has been passed to the script.  This is
      supposedly because at the beginning the script was placed
      outside of the ruby source tree.  Decades passed since the merge
      of YARV, now I can safely assume this feature is obsolescent.
      Just ignore the passed value here.
    end

    this.on "-L", "--vpath=SPEC", <<-'end'
      Likewise, this option is no longer supported.
    end

    this.on "--path-separator=SEP", /\A(?:\W\z|\.(\W).+)/, <<-'end'
      Old script says this option is a "separator for vpath".  I am
      confident we no longer need this option.
    end

    this.on "-Dname", "--enable=name[,name...]", Array, <<-'end'
      This option used to override VM option that is defined in
      vm_opts.h. Now it is officially unsupported because vm_opts.h to
      remain mismatched with this option must break things.  Just edit
      vm_opts.h directly.
    end

    this.on "-Uname", "--disable=name[,name...]", Array, <<-'end'
      This option used to override VM option that is defined in
      vm_opts.h. Now it is officially unsupported because vm_opts.h to
      remain mismatched with this option must break things.  Just edit
      vm_opts.h directly.
    end

    this.on "-i", "--insnsdef=FILE", "--instructions-def", <<-'end'
      This option used to specify alternative path to insns.def.  For
      the same reason to ignore -I, we no longer support this.
    end

    this.on "-o", "--opt-operanddef=FILE", "--opt-operand-def", <<-'end'
      This option used to specify alternative path to opt_operand.def.
      For the same reason to ignore -I, we no longer support this.
    end

    this.on "-u", "--opt-insnunifdef=FILE", "--opt-insn-unif-def", <<-'end'
      This option used to specify alternative path to
      opt_insn_unif.def.  For the same reason to ignore -I, we no
      longer support this.
    end

    this.on "-C", "--[no-]use-const", <<-'end'
      We use const whenever possible now so this option is ignored.
      The author believes that C compilers can constant-fold.
    end

    this.on "-d", "--destdir", "--output-directory=DIR", <<-'begin' do |dir|
      THIS IS THE ONLY OPTION THAT WORKS today.  Change destination
      directory from the current working directory to the given path.
    begin
      Dir.chdir dir
    end

    this.on "-V", "--[no-]verbose", <<-'end'
      Please let us ignore this and be modest.
    end
  end
