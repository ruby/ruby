# Running tests of RBS gem may fail because of various reasons.
# You can skip tests of RBS gem using this file, instead of pushing a new commit to `ruby/rbs` repository.
#
# The most frequently seen reason is the incompatibilities introduced to the unreleased version, including
#
# * Strict argument type check is introduced
# * A required method parameter is added
# * A method/class is removed
#
# Feel free to skip the tests with this file for that case.
#
# Syntax:
#
#   $(test-case-name) ` ` $(optional comment)    # Skipping single test case
#   $(test-class-name) ` ` $(optional comment)   # Skipping a test class
#
