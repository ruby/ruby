    This is just a loader for "readline". If Ruby has "readline-ext" gem that
    is a native extension, this gem will load it first. If Ruby doesn't have
    the "readline-ext" gem this gem will load "reline" that is a compatible
    library with "readline-ext" gem and is implemented by pure Ruby.
