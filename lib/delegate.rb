# = delegate -- Support for the Delegation Pattern
#
# Documentation by James Edward Gray II and Gavin Sinclair

##
# This library provides three different ways to delegate method calls to an
# object.  The easiest to use is SimpleDelegator.  Pass an object to the
# constructor and all methods supported by the object will be delegated.  This
# object can be changed later.
#
# Going a step further, the top level DelegateClass method allows you to easily
# setup delegation through class inheritance.  This is considerably more
# flexible and thus probably the most common use for this library.
#
# Finally, if you need full control over the delegation scheme, you can inherit
# from the abstract class Delegator and customize as needed.  (If you find
# yourself needing this control, have a look at Forwardable which is also in
# the standard library.  It may suit your needs better.)
#
# SimpleDelegator's implementation serves as a nice example of the use of
# Delegator:
#
#   class SimpleDelegator < Delegator
#     def __getobj__
#       @delegate_sd_obj # return object we are delegating to, required
#     end
#
#     def __setobj__(obj)
#       @delegate_sd_obj = obj # change delegation object,
#                              # a feature we're providing
#     end
#   end
#
# == Notes
#
# Be advised, RDoc will not detect delegated methods.
