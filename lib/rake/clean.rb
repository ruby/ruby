# The 'rake/clean' file defines two file lists (CLEAN and CLOBBER) and
# two rake tasks (:clean and :clobber).
#
# [:clean] Clean up the project by deleting scratch files and backup
#          files.  Add files to the CLEAN file list to have the :clean
#          target handle them.
#
# [:clobber] Clobber all generated and non-source files in a project.
#            The task depends on :clean, so all the clean files will
#            be deleted as well as files in the CLOBBER file list.
#            The intent of this task is to return a project to its
#            pristine, just unpacked state.
