# Timeout long-running blocks
#
# == Synopsis
#
#   require 'timeout'
#   status = Timeout::timeout(5) {
#     # Something that should be interrupted if it takes more than 5 seconds...
#   }
#
# == Description
#
# Timeout provides a way to auto-terminate a potentially long-running
# operation if it hasn't finished in a fixed amount of time.
#
# Previous versions didn't use a module for namespacing, however
# #timeout is provided for backwards compatibility.  You
# should prefer Timeout#timeout instead.

  # Perform an operation in a block, timing it out if it takes longer
  # than +sec+ seconds to complete.
  #
  # +sec+:: number of seconds to wait for the block to terminate
  # +klass+:: Exception Class to raise if the block fails to terminate
  #           in +sec+ seconds.  Omitting will use the default, Timeout::Error
  #
  # The block will be executed on another thread and will be given one
  # argument: +sec+.
  #
  # Returns the result of the block *if* the block completed before
  # +sec+ seconds, otherwise throws an exception, based on the value of +klass+.
  #
  # Note that this is both a method of module Timeout, so you can <tt>include
  # Timeout</tt> into your classes so they have a #timeout method, as well as
  # a module method, so you can call it directly as Timeout.timeout().
