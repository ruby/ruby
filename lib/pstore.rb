require "digest"

# \PStore implements a file based persistence mechanism based on a Hash.
# User code can store hierarchies of Ruby objects (values)
# into the data store by name (keys).
# An object hierarchy may be just a single object.
# User code may later read values back from the data store
# or even update data, as needed.
#
# The transactional behavior ensures that any changes succeed or fail together.
# This can be used to ensure that the data store is not left in a transitory state,
# where some values were updated but others were not.
#
# Behind the scenes, Ruby objects are stored to the data store file with Marshal.
# That carries the usual limitations. Proc objects cannot be marshalled,
# for example.
#
# There are three important concepts here (details at the links):
#
# - {Store}[rdoc-ref:PStore@The+Store]: a store is an instance of \PStore.
# - {Entries}[rdoc-ref:PStore@Entries]: the store is hash-like;
#   each entry is the key for a stored object.
# - {Transactions}[rdoc-ref:PStore@Transactions]: each transaction is a collection
#   of prospective changes to the store;
#   a transaction is defined in the block given with a call
#   to PStore#transaction.
#
# == About the Examples
#
# Examples on this page need a store that has known properties.
# They can get a new (and populated) store by calling thus:
#
#   example_store do |store|
#     # Example code using store goes here.
#   end
#
# All we really need to know about +example_store+
# is that it yields a fresh store with a known population of entries;
# its implementation:
#
#   require 'pstore'
#   require 'tempfile'
#   # Yield a pristine store for use in examples.
#   def example_store
#     # Create the store in a temporary file.
#     Tempfile.create do |file|
#       store = PStore.new(file)
#       # Populate the store.
#       store.transaction do
#         store[:foo] = 0
#         store[:bar] = 1
#         store[:baz] = 2
#       end
#       yield store
#     end
#   end
#
# == The Store
#
# The contents of the store are maintained in a file whose path is specified
# when the store is created (see PStore.new).
# The objects are stored and retrieved using
# module Marshal, which means that certain objects cannot be added to the store;
# see {Marshal::dump}[rdoc-ref:Marshal.dump].
#
# == Entries
#
# A store may have any number of entries.
# Each entry has a key and a value, just as in a hash:
#
# - Key: as in a hash, the key can be (almost) any object;
#   see {Hash Keys}[rdoc-ref:Hash@Hash+Keys].
#   You may find it convenient to keep it simple by using only
#   symbols or strings as keys.
# - Value: the value may be any object that can be marshalled by \Marshal
#   (see {Marshal::dump}[rdoc-ref:Marshal.dump])
#   and in fact may be a collection
#   (e.g., an array, a hash, a set, a range, etc).
#   That collection may in turn contain nested objects,
#   including collections, to any depth;
#   those objects must also be \Marshal-able.
#   See {Hierarchical Values}[rdoc-ref:PStore@Hierarchical+Values].
#
# == Transactions
#
# === The Transaction Block
#
# The block given with a call to method #transaction#
# contains a _transaction_,
# which consists of calls to \PStore methods that
# read from or write to the store
# (that is, all \PStore methods except #transaction itself,
# #path, and Pstore.new):
#
#   example_store do |store|
#     store.transaction do
#       store.keys # => [:foo, :bar, :baz]
#       store[:bat] = 3
#       store.keys # => [:foo, :bar, :baz, :bat]
#     end
#   end
#
# Execution of the transaction is deferred until the block exits,
# and is executed _atomically_ (all-or-nothing):
# either all transaction calls are executed, or none are.
# This maintains the integrity of the store.
#
# Other code in the block (including even calls to #path and PStore.new)
# is executed immediately, not deferred.
#
# The transaction block:
#
# - May not contain a nested call to #transaction.
# - Is the only context where methods that read from or write to
#   the store are allowed.
#
# As seen above, changes in a transaction are made automatically
# when the block exits.
# The block may be exited early by calling method #commit or #abort.
#
# - Method #commit triggers the update to the store and exits the block:
#
#     example_store do |store|
#       store.transaction do
#         store.keys # => [:foo, :bar, :baz]
#         store[:bat] = 3
#         store.commit
#         fail 'Cannot get here'
#       end
#       store.transaction do
#         # Update was completed.
#         store.keys # => [:foo, :bar, :baz, :bat]
#       end
#     end
#
# - Method #abort discards the update to the store and exits the block:
#
#     example_store do |store|
#       store.transaction do
#         store.keys # => [:foo, :bar, :baz]
#         store[:bat] = 3
#         store.abort
#         fail 'Cannot get here'
#       end
#       store.transaction do
#         # Update was not completed.
#         store.keys # => [:foo, :bar, :baz]
#       end
#     end
#
# === Read-Only Transactions
#
# By default, a transaction allows both reading from and writing to
# the store:
#
#   store.transaction do
#     # Read-write transaction.
#     # Any code except a call to #transaction is allowed here.
#   end
#
# If argument +read_only+ is passed as +true+,
# only reading is allowed:
#
#   store.transaction(true) do
#     # Read-only transaction:
#     # Calls to #transaction, #[]=, and #delete are not allowed here.
#   end
#
# == Hierarchical Values
#
# The value for an entry may be a simple object (as seen above).
# It may also be a hierarchy of objects nested to any depth:
#
#   deep_store = PStore.new('deep.store')
#   deep_store.transaction do
#     array_of_hashes = [{}, {}, {}]
#     deep_store[:array_of_hashes] = array_of_hashes
#     deep_store[:array_of_hashes] # => [{}, {}, {}]
#     hash_of_arrays = {foo: [], bar: [], baz: []}
#     deep_store[:hash_of_arrays] = hash_of_arrays
#     deep_store[:hash_of_arrays]  # => {:foo=>[], :bar=>[], :baz=>[]}
#     deep_store[:hash_of_arrays][:foo].push(:bat)
#     deep_store[:hash_of_arrays]  # => {:foo=>[:bat], :bar=>[], :baz=>[]}
#   end
#
# And recall that you can use
# {dig methods}[rdoc-ref:dig_methods.rdoc]
# in a returned hierarchy of objects.
#
# == Working with the Store
#
# === Creating a Store
#
# Use method PStore.new to create a store.
# The new store creates or opens its containing file:
#
#   store = PStore.new('t.store')
#
# === Modifying the Store
#
# Use method #[]= to update or create an entry:
#
#   example_store do |store|
#     store.transaction do
#       store[:foo] = 1 # Update.
#       store[:bam] = 1 # Create.
#     end
#   end
#
# Use method #delete to remove an entry:
#
#   example_store do |store|
#     store.transaction do
#       store.delete(:foo)
#       store[:foo] # => nil
#     end
#   end
#
# === Retrieving Values
#
# Use method #fetch (allows default) or #[] (defaults to +nil+)
# to retrieve an entry:
#
#   example_store do |store|
#     store.transaction do
#       store[:foo]             # => 0
#       store[:nope]            # => nil
#       store.fetch(:baz)       # => 2
#       store.fetch(:nope, nil) # => nil
#       store.fetch(:nope)      # Raises exception.
#     end
#   end
#
# === Querying the Store
#
# Use method #key? to determine whether a given key exists:
#
#   example_store do |store|
#     store.transaction do
#       store.key?(:foo) # => true
#     end
#   end
#
# Use method #keys to retrieve keys:
#
#   example_store do |store|
#     store.transaction do
#       store.keys # => [:foo, :bar, :baz]
#     end
#   end
#
# Use method #path to retrieve the path to the store's underlying file;
# this method may be called from outside a transaction block:
#
#   store = PStore.new('t.store')
#   store.path # => "t.store"
#
# == Transaction Safety
#
# For transaction safety, see:
#
# - Optional argument +thread_safe+ at method PStore.new.
# - Attribute #ultra_safe.
#
# Needless to say, if you're storing valuable data with \PStore, then you should
# backup the \PStore file from time to time.
#
# == An Example Store
#
#  require "pstore"
#
#  # A mock wiki object.
#  class WikiPage
#
#    attr_reader :page_name
#

#      @revisions << {created: Time.now,
#                     author: author,
#                     contents: contents}
#    end
#
#    def wiki_page_references
#      [@page_name] + @revisions.last[:contents].scan(/\b(?:[A-Z]+[a-z]+){2,}/)
#    end
#
#  end
#
#  # Create a new wiki page.
#  home_page = WikiPage.new("HomePage", "James Edward Gray II",
#                           "A page about the JoysOfDocumentation..." )
#
#  wiki = PStore.new("wiki_pages.pstore")
#  # Update page data and the index together, or not at all.
#  wiki.transaction do
#    # Store page.
#    wiki[home_page.page_name] = home_page
#    # Create page index.
#    wiki[:wiki_index] ||= Array.new
#    # Update wiki index.
#    wiki[:wiki_index].push(*home_page.wiki_page_references)
#  end
#
#  # Read wiki data, setting argument read_only to true.
#  wiki.transaction(true) do
#    wiki.keys.each do |key|
#      puts key
#      puts wiki[key]
