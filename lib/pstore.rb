# = PStore -- Transactional File Storage for Ruby Objects
#
# pstore.rb -
#   originally by matz
#   documentation by Kev Jackson and James Edward Gray II
#   improved by Hongli Lai
#
# See PStore for documentation.

require "digest/md5"

#
# PStore implements a file based persistence mechanism based on a Hash.  User
# code can store hierarchies of Ruby objects (values) into the data store file
# by name (keys).  An object hierarchy may be just a single object.  User code
# may later read values back from the data store or even update data, as needed.
#
# The transactional behavior ensures that any changes succeed or fail together.
# This can be used to ensure that the data store is not left in a transitory
# state, where some values were updated but others were not.
#
# Behind the scenes, Ruby objects are stored to the data store file with
# Marshal.  That carries the usual limitations.  Proc objects cannot be
# marshalled, for example.
#
# == Usage example:
#
#  require "pstore"
#
#  # a mock wiki object...
#  class WikiPage
#    def initialize( page_name, author, contents )
#      @page_name = page_name
#      @revisions = Array.new
#
#      add_revision(author, contents)
#    end
#
#    attr_reader :page_name
#
#    def add_revision( author, contents )
#      @revisions << { :created  => Time.now,
#                      :author   => author,
#                      :contents => contents }
#    end
#
#    def wiki_page_references
#      [@page_name] + @revisions.last[:contents].scan(/\b(?:[A-Z]+[a-z]+){2,}/)
#    end
#
#    # ...
#  end
#
#  # create a new page...
#  home_page = WikiPage.new( "HomePage", "James Edward Gray II",
#                            "A page about the JoysOfDocumentation..." )
#
#  # then we want to update page data and the index together, or not at all...
#  wiki = PStore.new("wiki_pages.pstore")
#  wiki.transaction do  # begin transaction; do all of this or none of it
#    # store page...
#    wiki[home_page.page_name] = home_page
#    # ensure that an index has been created...
#    wiki[:wiki_index] ||= Array.new
#    # update wiki index...
#    wiki[:wiki_index].push(*home_page.wiki_page_references)
#  end                   # commit changes to wiki data store file
#
#  ### Some time later... ###
#
#  # read wiki data...
#  wiki.transaction(true) do  # begin read-only transaction, no changes allowed
#    wiki.roots.each do |data_root_name|
#      p data_root_name
#      p wiki[data_root_name]
#    end
#  end
#
# == Transaction modes
#
# By default, file integrity is only ensured as long as the operating system
# (and the underlying hardware) doesn't raise any unexpected I/O errors. If an
# I/O error occurs while PStore is writing to its file, then the file will
# become corrupted.
#
# You can prevent this by setting <em>pstore.ultra_safe = true</em>.
# However, this results in a minor performance loss, and only works on platforms
# that support atomic file renames. Please consult the documentation for
# +ultra_safe+ for details.
#
# Needless to say, if you're storing valuable data with PStore, then you should
# backup the PStore files from time to time.
class PStore
  RDWR_ACCESS = {mode: IO::RDWR | IO::CREAT | IO::BINARY, encoding: Encoding::ASCII_8BIT}.freeze
  RD_ACCESS = {mode: IO::RDONLY | IO::BINARY, encoding: Encoding::ASCII_8BIT}.freeze
  WR_ACCESS = {mode: IO::WRONLY | IO::CREAT | IO::TRUNC | IO::BINARY, encoding: Encoding::ASCII_8BIT}.freeze

  # The error type thrown by all PStore methods.
  class Error < StandardError
  end

  # Whether PStore should do its best to prevent file corruptions, even when under
  # unlikely-to-occur error conditions such as out-of-space conditions and other
  # unusual OS filesystem errors. Setting this flag comes at the price in the form
  # of a performance loss.
  #
  # This flag only has effect on platforms on which file renames are atomic (e.g.
  # all POSIX platforms: Linux, MacOS X, FreeBSD, etc). The default value is false.
