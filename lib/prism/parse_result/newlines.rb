    # * nodes that are children of statements lists

    # come back from the parser. We assign these offsets to the first nodes that
    # we find in the tree that are on those lines.

    # Note that the logic in this file should be kept in sync with the Java
    # MarkNewlinesVisitor, since that visitor is responsible for marking the
    # newlines for JRuby/TruffleRuby.
