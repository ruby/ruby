    # When we've parsed the source, we have both the syntax tree and the list of
    # comments that we found in the source. This class is responsible for
    # walking the tree and finding the nearest location to attach each comment.
    #
    # It does this by first finding the nearest locations to each comment.
    # Locations can either come from nodes directly or from location fields on
    # nodes. For example, a `ClassNode` has an overall location encompassing the
    # entire class, but it also has a location for the `class` keyword.
    #
    # Once the nearest locations are found, it determines which one to attach
    # to. If it's a trailing comment (a comment on the same line as other source
    # code), it will favor attaching to the nearest location that occurs before
    # the comment. Otherwise it will favor attaching to the nearest location
    # that is after the comment.
