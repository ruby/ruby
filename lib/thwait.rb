# This class watches for termination of multiple threads.  Basic functionality
# (wait until specified threads have terminated) can be accessed through the
# class method ThreadsWait::all_waits.  Finer control can be gained using
# instance methods.
#
# Example:
#
#   ThreadsWait.all_waits(thr1, thr2, ...) do |t|
#     STDERR.puts "Thread #{t} has terminated."
#   end
#
#
#   th = ThreadsWait.new(thread1,...)
#   th.next_wait # next one to be done
#
#

  # Waits until all specified threads have terminated.  If a block is provided,
  # it is executed for each thread as they terminate.

  # Waits until any of the specified threads has terminated, and returns the one
  # that does.

    end
  end

  #
  # Waits until all of the specified threads are terminated.  If a block is
  # supplied for the method, it is executed for each thread termination.
  #
  # Raises exceptions in the same manner as +next_wait+.
