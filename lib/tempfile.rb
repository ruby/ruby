require 'delegate'
require 'tmpdir'

# A utility class for managing temporary files. When you create a Tempfile
# object, it will create a temporary file with a unique filename. A Tempfile
# objects behaves just like a File object, and you can perform all the usual
# file operations on it: reading data, writing data, changing its permissions,
# etc. So although this class does not explicitly document all instance methods
# supported by File, you can in fact call any File instance method on a
# Tempfile object.
#
# == Synopsis
#
#   require 'tempfile'
#
#   file = Tempfile.new('foo')
#   file.path      # => A unique filename in the OS's temp directory,
#                  #    e.g.: "/tmp/foo.24722.0"
#                  #    This filename contains 'foo' in its basename.
#   file.write("hello world")
#   file.rewind
#   file.read      # => "hello world"
#   file.close
#   file.unlink    # deletes the temp file
#
# == Good practices
#
# === Explicit close
#
# When a Tempfile object is garbage collected, or when the Ruby interpreter
# exits, its associated temporary file is automatically deleted. This means
# that it's unnecessary to explicitly delete a Tempfile after use, though
# it's a good practice to do so: not explicitly deleting unused Tempfiles can
# potentially leave behind a large number of temp files on the filesystem
# until they're garbage collected. The existence of these temp files can make
# it harder to determine a new Tempfile filename.
#
# Therefore, one should always call #unlink or close in an ensure block, like
# this:
#
#   file = Tempfile.new('foo')
#   begin
#      # ...do something with file...
#   ensure
#      file.close
#      file.unlink   # deletes the temp file
#   end
#
# Tempfile.create { ... } exists for this purpose and is more convenient to use.
# Note that Tempfile.create returns a File instance instead of a Tempfile, which
# also avoids the overhead and complications of delegation.
#
#   Tempfile.create('foo') do |file|
#      # ...do something with file...
#   end
#
# === Unlink after creation
#
# On POSIX systems, it's possible to unlink a file right after creating it,
# and before closing it. This removes the filesystem entry without closing
# the file handle, so it ensures that only the processes that already had
# the file handle open can access the file's contents. It's strongly
# recommended that you do this if you do not want any other processes to
# be able to read from or write to the Tempfile, and you do not need to
# know the Tempfile's filename either.
#
# For example, a practical use case for unlink-after-creation would be this:
# you need a large byte buffer that's too large to comfortably fit in RAM,
# e.g. when you're writing a web server and you want to buffer the client's
# file upload data.
#
# Please refer to #unlink for more information and a code example.
#
# == Minor notes
#
# Tempfile's filename picking method is both thread-safe and inter-process-safe:
# it guarantees that no other threads or processes will pick the same filename.
#
# Tempfile itself however may not be entirely thread-safe. If you access the
# same Tempfile object from multiple threads then you should protect it with a
# mutex.
class Tempfile < DelegateClass(File)

  # The version
  VERSION = "0.2.1"

  # Creates a file in the underlying file system;
  # returns a new \Tempfile object based on that file.
  #
  # If possible, consider instead using Tempfile.create, which:
  #
  # - Avoids the performance cost of delegation,
  #   incurred when Tempfile.new calls its superclass <tt>DelegateClass(File)</tt>.
  # - Does not rely on a finalizer to close and unlink the file,
  #   which can be unreliable.
  #
  # Creates and returns file whose:
  #
  # - Class is \Tempfile (not \File, as in Tempfile.create).
  # - Directory is the system temporary directory (system-dependent).
  # - Generated filename is unique in that directory.
  # - Permissions are <tt>0600</tt>;
  #   see {File Permissions}[rdoc-ref:File@File+Permissions].
  # - Mode is <tt>'w+'</tt> (read/write mode, positioned at the end).
  #
  # The underlying file is removed when the \Tempfile object dies
  # and is reclaimed by the garbage collector.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   f = Tempfile.new # => #<Tempfile:/tmp/20220505-17839-1s0kt30>
  #   f.class               # => Tempfile
  #   f.path                # => "/tmp/20220505-17839-1s0kt30"
  #   f.stat.mode.to_s(8)   # => "100600"
  #   File.exist?(f.path)   # => true
  #   File.unlink(f.path)   #
  #   File.exist?(f.path)   # => false
  #
  # Argument +basename+, if given, may be one of:
  #
  # - A string: the generated filename begins with +basename+:
  #
  #     Tempfile.new('foo') # => #<Tempfile:/tmp/foo20220505-17839-1whk2f>
  #
  # - An array of two strings <tt>[prefix, suffix]</tt>:
  #   the generated filename begins with +prefix+ and ends with +suffix+:
  #
  #     Tempfile.new(%w/foo .jpg/) # => #<Tempfile:/tmp/foo20220505-17839-58xtfi.jpg>
  #
  # With arguments +basename+ and +tmpdir+, the file is created in directory +tmpdir+:
  #
  #   Tempfile.new('foo', '.') # => #<Tempfile:./foo20220505-17839-xfstr8>
  #
  # Keyword arguments +mode+ and +options+ are passed directly to method
  # {File.open}[rdoc-ref:File.open]:

  # write code like this:
  #
  #   file = Tempfile.new('foo')
  #   file.unlink   # On Windows this silently fails.
  #   begin
  #      # ... do something with file ...
  #   ensure
  #      file.close!   # Closes the file handle. If the file wasn't unlinked
  #                    # because #unlink failed, then this method will attempt
  #                    # to do so again.
