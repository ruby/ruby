require 'delegate'
require 'tmpdir'

# A utility class for managing temporary files. When you create a Tempfile
# object, it will create a temporary file with a unique filename. A Tempfile
# objects behaves just like a File object, and you can perform all the usual
# file operations on it: reading data, writing data, changing its permissions,
# etc. So although this class does not explicitly document all instance methods
# supported by File, you can in fact call any File instance method on a
# Tempfile object.
#
# == Synopsis
#
#   require 'tempfile'
#
#   file = Tempfile.new('foo')
#   file.path      # => A unique filename in the OS's temp directory,
#                  #    e.g.: "/tmp/foo.24722.0"
#                  #    This filename contains 'foo' in its basename.
#   file.write("hello world")
#   file.rewind
#   file.read      # => "hello world"
#   file.close
#   file.unlink    # deletes the temp file
#
# == Good practices
#
# === Explicit close
#
# When a Tempfile object is garbage collected, or when the Ruby interpreter
# exits, its associated temporary file is automatically deleted. This means
# that's it's unnecessary to explicitly delete a Tempfile after use, though
# it's good practice to do so: not explicitly deleting unused Tempfiles can
# potentially leave behind large amounts of tempfiles on the filesystem
# until they're garbage collected. The existence of these temp files can make
# it harder to determine a new Tempfile filename.
#
# Therefore, one should always call #unlink or close in an ensure block, like
# this:
#
#   file = Tempfile.new('foo')
#   begin
#      # ...do something with file...
#   ensure
#      file.close
#      file.unlink   # deletes the temp file
#   end
#
# === Unlink after creation
#
# On POSIX systems, it's possible to unlink a file right after creating it,
# and before closing it. This removes the filesystem entry without closing
# the file handle, so it ensures that only the processes that already had
# the file handle open can access the file's contents. It's strongly
# recommended that you do this if you do not want any other processes to
# be able to read from or write to the Tempfile, and you do not need to
# know the Tempfile's filename either.
#
# For example, a practical use case for unlink-after-creation would be this:
# you need a large byte buffer that's too large to comfortably fit in RAM,
# e.g. when you're writing a web server and you want to buffer the client's
# file upload data.
#
# Please refer to #unlink for more information and a code example.
#
# == Minor notes
#
# Tempfile's filename picking method is both thread-safe and inter-process-safe:
# it guarantees that no other threads or processes will pick the same filename.
#
# Tempfile itself however may not be entirely thread-safe. If you access the
# same Tempfile object from multiple threads then you should protect it with a
# mutex.
class Tempfile < DelegateClass(File)
  # Creates a temporary file with permissions 0600 (= only readable and
  # writable by the owner) and opens it with mode "w+".
  #
  # The +basename+ parameter is used to determine the name of the
  # temporary file. You can either pass a String or an Array with
  # 2 String elements. In the former form, the temporary file's base
  # name will begin with the given string. In the latter form,
  # the temporary file's base name will begin with the array's first
  # element, and end with the second element. For example:
  #
  #   file = Tempfile.new('hello')
  #   file.path  # => something like: "/tmp/hello2843-8392-92849382--0"
  #
  #   # Use the Array form to enforce an extension in the filename:
  #   file = Tempfile.new(['hello', '.jpg'])
  #   file.path  # => something like: "/tmp/hello2843-8392-92849382--0.jpg"
  #
  # The temporary file will be placed in the directory as specified
  # by the +tmpdir+ parameter. By default, this is +Dir.tmpdir+.
  #
  #   file = Tempfile.new('hello', '/home/aisaka')
  #   file.path  # => something like: "/home/aisaka/hello2843-8392-92849382--0"
  #
  # You can also pass an options hash. Under the hood, Tempfile creates
  # the temporary file using +File.open+. These options will be passed to
  # +File.open+. This is mostly useful for specifying encoding
  # options, e.g.:
  #
  #   Tempfile.new('hello', '/home/aisaka', encoding: 'ascii-8bit')
  #
  #   # You can also omit the 'tmpdir' parameter:
  #   Tempfile.new('hello', encoding: 'ascii-8bit')
  #
  # Note: +mode+ keyword argument, as accepted by Tempfile, can only be
  # numeric, combination of the modes defined in File::Constants.
  #
  # === Exceptions
  #
  # If Tempfile.new cannot find a unique filename within a limited
  # number of tries, then it will raise an exception.

  #
  #   file = Tempfile.new('foo')
  #   begin

  # === Unlink-before-close
  #
  # On POSIX systems it's possible to unlink a file before closing it. This
  # practice is explained in detail in the Tempfile overview (section
  # "Unlink after creation"); please refer there for more information.
  #
  # However, unlink-before-close may not be supported on non-POSIX operating
  # systems. Microsoft Windows is the most notable case: unlinking a non-closed
  # file will result in an error, which this method will silently ignore. If
  # you want to practice unlink-before-close whenever possible, then you should
  # write code like this:
  #
  #   file = Tempfile.new('foo')
  #   file.unlink   # On Windows this silently fails.
  #   begin
  #      # ... do something with file ...
  #   ensure
  #      file.close!   # Closes the file handle. If the file wasn't unlinked
  #                    # because #unlink failed, then this method will attempt
  #                    # to do so again.
