# cgi/session/pstore.rb - persistent storage of marshalled session data

# Documentation: William Webber (william@williamwebber.com)
#
# == Overview
#
# This file provides the CGI::Session::PStore class, which builds
# persistent of session data on top of the pstore library.  See
# cgi/session.rb for more details on session storage managers.

  class Session
    # PStore-based session storage class.
    #
    # This builds upon the top-level PStore class provided by the
    # library file pstore.rb.  Session data is marshalled and stored
    # in a file.  File locking and transaction services are provided.
    class PStore
      # Create a new CGI::Session::PStore instance
      #
      # This constructor is used internally by CGI::Session.  The
      # user does not generally need to call it directly.
      #
      # +session+ is the session for which this instance is being
      # created.  The session id must only contain alphanumeric
      # characters; automatically generated session ids observe
      # this requirement.
      #
      # +option+ is a hash of options for the initializer.  The
      # following options are recognised:
      #
      # tmpdir:: the directory to use for storing the PStore
      #          file.  Defaults to Dir::tmpdir (generally "/tmp"
      #          on Unix systems).
      # prefix:: the prefix to add to the session id when generating
      #          the filename for this session's PStore file.
      #          Defaults to the empty string.
      #
      # This session's PStore file will be created if it does
      # not exist, or opened if it does.
