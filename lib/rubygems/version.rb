# frozen_string_literal: true
##
# The Version class processes string versions into comparable
# values. A version string should normally be a series of numbers
# separated by periods. Each part (digits separated by periods) is
# considered its own number, and these are used for sorting. So for
# instance, 3.10 sorts higher than 3.2 because ten is greater than
# two.
#
# If any part contains letters (currently only a-z are supported) then
# that version is considered prerelease. Versions with a prerelease
# part in the Nth part sort less than versions with N-1
# parts. Prerelease parts are sorted alphabetically using the normal
# Ruby string sorting rules. If a prerelease part contains both
# letters and numbers, it will be broken into multiple parts to
# provide expected sort behavior (1.0.a10 becomes 1.0.a.10, and is
# greater than 1.0.a9).
#
# Prereleases sort between real releases (newest to oldest):
#
# 1. 1.0
# 2. 1.0.b1
# 3. 1.0.a.2
# 4. 0.9
#
# If you want to specify a version restriction that includes both prereleases
# and regular releases of the 1.x series this is the best way:
#
#   s.add_dependency 'example', '>= 1.0.0.a', '< 2.0.0'
#
# == How Software Changes
#
# Users expect to be able to specify a version constraint that gives them
# some reasonable expectation that new versions of a library will work with
# their software if the version constraint is true, and not work with their
# software if the version constraint is false.  In other words, the perfect
# system will accept all compatible versions of the library and reject all
# incompatible versions.
#
# Libraries change in 3 ways (well, more than 3, but stay focused here!).
#
# 1. The change may be an implementation detail only and have no effect on
#    the client software.
# 2. The change may add new features, but do so in a way that client software
#    written to an earlier version is still compatible.
# 3. The change may change the public interface of the library in such a way
#    that old software is no longer compatible.
#
# Some examples are appropriate at this point.  Suppose I have a Stack class
# that supports a <tt>push</tt> and a <tt>pop</tt> method.
#
# === Examples of Category 1 changes:
#
# * Switch from an array based implementation to a linked-list based
#   implementation.
# * Provide an automatic (and transparent) backing store for large stacks.
#
# === Examples of Category 2 changes might be:
#
# * Add a <tt>depth</tt> method to return the current depth of the stack.
# * Add a <tt>top</tt> method that returns the current top of stack (without
#   changing the stack).
# * Change <tt>push</tt> so that it returns the item pushed (previously it
#   had no usable return value).
#
# === Examples of Category 3 changes might be:
#
# * Changes <tt>pop</tt> so that it no longer returns a value (you must use
#   <tt>top</tt> to get the top of the stack).
# * Rename the methods to <tt>push_item</tt> and <tt>pop_item</tt>.
#
# == RubyGems Rational Versioning
#
# * Versions shall be represented by three non-negative integers, separated
#   by periods (e.g. 3.1.4).  The first integers is the "major" version
#   number, the second integer is the "minor" version number, and the third
#   integer is the "build" number.
#
# * A category 1 change (implementation detail) will increment the build
#   number.
#
# * A category 2 change (backwards compatible) will increment the minor
#   version number and reset the build number.
#
# * A category 3 change (incompatible) will increment the major build number
#   and reset the minor and build numbers.
#
# * Any "public" release of a gem should have a different version.  Normally
#   that means incrementing the build number.  This means a developer can
#   generate builds all day long, but as soon as they make a public release,
#   the version must be updated.
#
# === Examples
#
# Let's work through a project lifecycle using our Stack example from above.
#
# Version 0.0.1:: The initial Stack class is release.
# Version 0.0.2:: Switched to a linked=list implementation because it is
#                 cooler.
# Version 0.1.0:: Added a <tt>depth</tt> method.
# Version 1.0.0:: Added <tt>top</tt> and made <tt>pop</tt> return nil
#                 (<tt>pop</tt> used to return the  old top item).
# Version 1.1.0:: <tt>push</tt> now returns the value pushed (it used it
#                 return nil).
# Version 1.1.1:: Fixed a bug in the linked list implementation.
# Version 1.1.2:: Fixed a bug introduced in the last fix.
#
# Client A needs a stack with basic push/pop capability.  They write to the
# original interface (no <tt>top</tt>), so their version constraint looks like:
#
#   gem 'stack', '>= 0.0'
#
# Essentially, any version is OK with Client A.  An incompatible change to
# the library will cause them grief, but they are willing to take the chance
# (we call Client A optimistic).
#
# Client B is just like Client A except for two things: (1) They use the
# <tt>depth</tt> method and (2) they are worried about future
# incompatibilities, so they write their version constraint like this:
#
#   gem 'stack', '~> 0.1'
#
# The <tt>depth</tt> method was introduced in version 0.1.0, so that version
# or anything later is fine, as long as the version stays below version 1.0
# where incompatibilities are introduced.  We call Client B pessimistic
# because they are worried about incompatible future changes (it is OK to be
# pessimistic!).
#
# == Preventing Version Catastrophe:
#
# From: http://blog.zenspider.com/2008/10/rubygems-howto-preventing-cata.html
#
# Let's say you're depending on the fnord gem version 2.y.z. If you
# specify your dependency as ">= 2.0.0" then, you're good, right? What
# happens if fnord 3.0 comes out and it isn't backwards compatible
# with 2.y.z? Your stuff will break as a result of using ">=". The
# better route is to specify your dependency with an "approximate" version
# specifier ("~>"). They're a tad confusing, so here is how the dependency
# specifiers work:
#
#   Specification From  ... To (exclusive)
#   ">= 3.0"      3.0   ... &infin;
#   "~> 3.0"      3.0   ... 4.0
#   "~> 3.0.0"    3.0.0 ... 3.1
#   "~> 3.5"      3.5   ... 4.0
#   "~> 3.5.0"    3.5.0 ... 3.6
#   "~> 3"        3.0   ... 4.0
#
# For the last example, single-digit versions are automatically extended with
# a zero to give a sensible result.
