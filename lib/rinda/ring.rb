  # A RingServer allows a Rinda::TupleSpace to be located via UDP broadcasts.
  # Default service location uses the following steps:
  #
  # 1. A RingServer begins listening on the network broadcast UDP address.
  # 2. A RingFinger sends a UDP packet containing the DRb URI where it will
  #    listen for a reply.
  # 3. The RingServer receives the UDP packet and connects back to the
  #    provided DRb URI with the DRb service.
  #
  # A RingServer requires a TupleSpace:
  #
  #   ts = Rinda::TupleSpace.new
  #   rs = Rinda::RingServer.new
  #
  # RingServer can also listen on multicast addresses for announcements.  This
  # allows multiple RingServers to run on the same host.  To use network
  # broadcast and multicast:
  #
  #   ts = Rinda::TupleSpace.new
  #   rs = Rinda::RingServer.new ts, %w[Socket::INADDR_ANY, 239.0.0.1 ff02::1]
