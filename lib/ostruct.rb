# OpenStruct allows the creation of data objects with arbitrary attributes.
# See OpenStruct for an example.
#

#
# An OpenStruct is a data structure, similar to a Hash, that allows the
# definition of arbitrary attributes with their accompanying values. This is
# accomplished by using Ruby's metaporgramming to define methods on the class
# itself.
#
# == Examples:
#
#   require 'ostruct'
#
#   person = OpenStruct.new
#   person.name    = "John Smith"
#   person.age     = 70
#   person.pension = 300
#
#   puts person.name     # -> "John Smith"
#   puts person.age      # -> 70
#   puts person.address  # -> nil
#
# An OpenStruct employs a Hash internally to store the methods and values and
# can even be initialized with one:
#
#   country_data = { :country => "Australia", :population => 20_000_000 }
#   australia = OpenStruct.new(country_data)
#   p australia   # -> <OpenStruct country="Australia" population=20000000>
#
# You may also define the hash in the initialization call:
#
#   australia = OpenStruct.new(:country => "Australia", :population => 20_000_000)
#   p australia   # -> <OpenStruct country="Australia" population=20000000>
#
# Hash keys with spaces or characters that would normally not be able to use for
# method calls (e.g. ()[]*) will not be immediately available on the
# OpenStruct object as a method for retrieval or assignment, but can be still be
# reached through the Object#send method.
#
#   measurements = OpenStruct.new("length (in inches)" => 24)
#   measurements.send("length (in inches)")  # -> 24
#
#   data_point = OpenStruct.new(:queued? => true)
#   data_point.queued?                       # -> true
#   data_point.send("queued?=",false)
#   data_point.queued?                       # -> false
#
# Removing the presence of a method requires the execution the delete_field
# method as setting the property value to +nil+ will not remove the method.
#
#   first_pet = OpenStruct.new(:name => 'Rowdy', :owner => 'John Smith')
#   first_pet.owner = nil
#   second_pet = OpenStruct.new(:name => 'Rowdy')
#
#   first_pet == second_pet   # -> false
#
#   first_pet.delete_field(:owner)
#   first_pet == second_pet   # -> true
#
#
# == Implementation:
#
# An OpenStruct utilizes Ruby's method lookup structure to and find and define
# the necessary methods for properties. This is accomplished through the method
# method_missing and define_method.
#
# This should be a consideration if there is a concern about the performance of
# the objects that are created. As there is much more overhead in the setting
# of these properties compard to utilizing a Hash or a Struct.
#
class OpenStruct
  #
  # Creates a new OpenStruct object.  By default, the resulting OpenStruct
  # object will have no attributes.
  #
  # The optional +hash+, if given, will generate attributes and values.
  # For example:
  #
  #   require 'ostruct'
  #   hash = { "country" => "Australia", :population => 20_000_000 }
  #   data = OpenStruct.new(hash)
  #
  #   p data        # -> <OpenStruct country="Australia" population=20000000>
  #
  # You may also define the hash in the initialization call:
  #
  #   australia = OpenStruct.new(:country => "Australia",
  #                              :population => 20_000_000)
  #   p australia   # -> <OpenStruct country="Australia" population=20000000>
  #
