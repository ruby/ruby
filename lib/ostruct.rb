# OpenStruct allows the creation of data objects with arbitrary attributes.
# See OpenStruct for an example.
#

#
# An OpenStruct is a data structure, similar to a Hash, that allows the
# definition of arbitrary attributes with their accompanying values. This is
# accomplished by using Ruby's metaprogramming to define methods on the class
# itself.
#
# == Examples
#
#   require "ostruct"
#
#   person = OpenStruct.new
#   person.name = "John Smith"
#   person.age  = 70
#
#   person.name      # => "John Smith"
#   person.age       # => 70
#   person.address   # => nil
#
# An OpenStruct employs a Hash internally to store the attributes and values
# and can even be initialized with one:
#
#   australia = OpenStruct.new(:country => "Australia", :capital => "Canberra")
#     # => #<OpenStruct country="Australia", capital="Canberra">
#
# Hash keys with spaces or characters that could normally not be used for
# method calls (e.g. <code>()[]*</code>) will not be immediately available
# on the OpenStruct object as a method for retrieval or assignment, but can
# still be reached through the Object#send method or using [].
#
#   measurements = OpenStruct.new("length (in inches)" => 24)
#   measurements[:"length (in inches)"]       # => 24
#   measurements.send("length (in inches)")   # => 24
#
#   message = OpenStruct.new(:queued? => true)
#   message.queued?                           # => true
#   message.send("queued?=", false)
#   message.queued?                           # => false
#
# Removing the presence of an attribute requires the execution of the
# delete_field method as setting the property value to +nil+ will not
# remove the attribute.
#
#   first_pet  = OpenStruct.new(:name => "Rowdy", :owner => "John Smith")
#   second_pet = OpenStruct.new(:name => "Rowdy")
#
#   first_pet.owner = nil
#   first_pet                 # => #<OpenStruct name="Rowdy", owner=nil>
#   first_pet == second_pet   # => false
#
#   first_pet.delete_field(:owner)
#   first_pet                 # => #<OpenStruct name="Rowdy">
#   first_pet == second_pet   # => true
#
# == Caveats
#
# An OpenStruct utilizes Ruby's method lookup structure to find and define the
# necessary methods for properties. This is accomplished through the methods
# method_missing and define_singleton_method.
#
# This should be a consideration if there is a concern about the performance of
# the objects that are created, as there is much more overhead in the setting
# of these properties compared to using a Hash or a Struct.
# Creating an open struct from a small Hash and accessing a few of the
# entries can be 200 times slower than accessing the hash directly.
#
# This may also be the source of incompatibilities between Ruby versions:
#
#   o = OpenStruct.new
#   o.then # => nil in Ruby < 2.6, enumerator for Ruby >= 2.6
#
# Builtin methods may be overwritten this way, which may be a source of bugs
# or security issues:
#
#   o = OpenStruct.new
#   o.methods # => [:to_h, :marshal_load, :marshal_dump, :each_pair, ...
#   o.methods = [:foo, :bar]
#   o.methods # => [:foo, :bar]
#
# To help remedy clashes, OpenStruct uses only protected/private methods ending with `!`
# and defines aliases for builtin public methods by adding a `!`:
#
#   o = OpenStruct.new(make: 'Bentley', class: :luxury)
#   o.class # => :luxury
#   o.class! # => OpenStruct
#
# It is recommended (but not enforced) to not use fields ending in `!`;
# Note that a subclass' methods may not be overwritten, nor can OpenStruct's own methods
# ending with `!`.
#
# For all these reasons, consider not using OpenStruct at all.
