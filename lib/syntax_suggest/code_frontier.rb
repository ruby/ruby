module SyntaxSuggest
  # The main function of the frontier is to hold the edges of our search and to
  # evaluate when we can stop searching.

  # There are three main phases in the algorithm:
  #
  # 1. Sanitize/format input source
  # 2. Search for invalid blocks
  # 3. Format invalid blocks into something meaninful
  #
  # The Code frontier is a critical part of the second step
  #
  # ## Knowing where we've been
  #
  # Once a code block is generated it is added onto the frontier. Then it will be
  # sorted by indentation and frontier can be filtered. Large blocks that fully enclose a
  # smaller block will cause the smaller block to be evicted.
  #
  #   CodeFrontier#<<(block) # Adds block to frontier
  #   CodeFrontier#pop # Removes block from frontier
  #
  # ## Knowing where we can go
  #
  # Internally the frontier keeps track of "unvisited" lines which are exposed via `next_indent_line`
  # when called, this method returns, a line of code with the highest indentation.
  #
  # The returned line of code can be used to build a CodeBlock and then that code block
  # is added back to the frontier. Then, the lines are removed from the
  # "unvisited" so we don't double-create the same block.
  #
  #   CodeFrontier#next_indent_line # Shows next line
  #   CodeFrontier#register_indent_block(block) # Removes lines from unvisited
  #
  # ## Knowing when to stop
  #
  # The frontier knows how to check the entire document for a syntax error. When blocks
  # are added onto the frontier, they're removed from the document. When all code containing
  # syntax errors has been added to the frontier, the document will be parsable without a
  # syntax error and the search can stop.
  #
  #   CodeFrontier#holds_all_syntax_errors? # Returns true when frontier holds all syntax errors
  #
  # ## Filtering false positives
  #
  # Once the search is completed, the frontier may have multiple blocks that do not contain
  # the syntax error. To limit the result to the smallest subset of "invalid blocks" call:
  #
  #   CodeFrontier#detect_invalid_blocks
  #
