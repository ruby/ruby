  # Turns a "invalid block(s)" into useful context
  #
  # There are three main phases in the algorithm:
  #
  # 1. Sanitize/format input source
  # 2. Search for invalid blocks
  # 3. Format invalid blocks into something meaninful
  #
  # This class handles the third part.
  #
  # The algorithm is very good at capturing all of a syntax
  # error in a single block in number 2, however the results
  # can contain ambiguities. Humans are good at pattern matching
  # and filtering and can mentally remove extraneous data, but
  # they can't add extra data that's not present.
  #
  # In the case of known ambiguious cases, this class adds context
  # back to the ambiguitiy so the programmer has full information.
  #
  # Beyond handling these ambiguities, it also captures surrounding
  # code context information:
  #
  #   puts block.to_s # => "def bark"
  #
  #   context = CaptureCodeContext.new(
  #     blocks: block,
  #     code_lines: code_lines
  #   )
  #
  #   lines = context.call.map(&:original)
  #   puts lines.join
  #   # =>
  #     class Dog
  #       def bark
  #     end
  #

    # Shows surrounding kw/end pairs
    #
    # The purpose of showing these extra pairs is due to cases
    # of ambiguity when only one visible line is matched.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #     1  class Dog
    #     2    def bark
    #     4    def eat
    #     5    end
    #     6  end
    #
    # In this case either line 2 could be missing an `end` or
    # line 4 was an extra line added by mistake (it happens).
    #
    # When we detect the above problem it shows the issue
    # as only being on line 2
    #
    #     2    def bark
    #
    # Showing "neighbor" keyword pairs gives extra context:
    #
    #     2    def bark
    #     4    def eat
    #     5    end
