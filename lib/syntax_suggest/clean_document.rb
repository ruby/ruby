module SyntaxSuggest
  # Parses and sanitizes source into a lexically aware document
  #
  # Internally the document is represented by an array with each
  # index containing a CodeLine correlating to a line from the source code.
  #
  # There are three main phases in the algorithm:
  #
  # 1. Sanitize/format input source
  # 2. Search for invalid blocks
  # 3. Format invalid blocks into something meaninful
  #
  # This class handles the first part.
  #
  # The reason this class exists is to format input source
  # for better/easier/cleaner exploration.
  #
  # The CodeSearch class operates at the line level so
  # we must be careful to not introduce lines that look
  # valid by themselves, but when removed will trigger syntax errors
  # or strange behavior.
  #
  # ## Join Trailing slashes
  #
  # Code with a trailing slash is logically treated as a single line:
  #
  #     1 it "code can be split" \
  #     2    "across multiple lines" do
  #
  # In this case removing line 2 would add a syntax error. We get around
  # this by internally joining the two lines into a single "line" object
  #
  # ## Logically Consecutive lines
  #
  # Code that can be broken over multiple
  # lines such as method calls are on different lines:
  #
  #     1 User.
  #     2   where(name: "schneems").
  #     3   first
  #
  # Removing line 2 can introduce a syntax error. To fix this, all lines
  # are joined into one.
  #
  # ## Heredocs
  #
  # A heredoc is an way of defining a multi-line string. They can cause many
  # problems. If left as a single line, Ripper would try to parse the contents
  # as ruby code rather than as a string. Even without this problem, we still
  # hit an issue with indentation
  #
  #    1 foo = <<~HEREDOC
  #    2  "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.""
  #    3    â€• Oscar Wilde
  #    4      puts "I look like ruby code" # but i'm still a heredoc
  #    5 HEREDOC
  #
  # If we didn't join these lines then our algorithm would think that line 4
  # is separate from the rest, has a higher indentation, then look at it first
  # and remove it.
  #
  # If the code evaluates line 5 by itself it will think line 5 is a constant,
  # remove it, and introduce a syntax errror.
  #
  # All of these problems are fixed by joining the whole heredoc into a single
  # line.
  #
  # ## Comments and whitespace
  #
  # Comments can throw off the way the lexer tells us that the line
  # logically belongs with the next line. This is valid ruby but
  # results in a different lex output than before:
  #
  #     1 User.
  #     2   where(name: "schneems").
  #     3   # Comment here
  #     4   first
  #
  # To handle this we can replace comment lines with empty lines
  # and then re-lex the source. This removal and re-lexing preserves
  # line index and document size, but generates an easier to work with
  # document.
  #

    #       puts "hello"

    #       puts "world"

    #
    # Important: This must be done before lexing.
    #
    # After this change is made, we lex the document because
    # removing comments can change how the doc is parsed.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #     values = LexAll.new(source: <<~EOM))
    #       User.
    #         # comment
    #         where(name: 'schneems')
    #     EOM
    #     expect(
    #       values.count {|v| v.type == :on_ignored_nl}
    #     ).to eq(1)
    #
    # After the comment is removed:
    #
    #     values = LexAll.new(source: <<~EOM))
    #       User.
    #
    #         where(name: 'schneems')
    #     EOM
    #     expect(
    #      values.count {|v| v.type == :on_ignored_nl}
    #    ).to eq(2)
