module SyntaxSuggest
  # Represents a single line of code of a given source file
  #
  # This object contains metadata about the line such as
  # amount of indentation, if it is empty or not, and
  # lexical data, such as if it has an `end` or a keyword
  # in it.
  #
  # Visibility of lines can be toggled off. Marking a line as invisible
  # indicates that it should not be used for syntax checks.
  # It's functionally the same as commenting it out.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   line = CodeLine.from_source("def foo\n").first
  #   line.number => 1
  #   line.empty? # => false
  #   line.visible? # => true
  #   line.mark_invisible
  #   line.visible? # => false
  #
