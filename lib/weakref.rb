# Weak Reference class that allows a referenced object to be
# garbage-collected.
#
# A WeakRef may be used exactly like the object it references.
#
# Usage:
#
#   foo = Object.new            # create a new object instance
#   p foo.to_s                  # original's class
#   foo = WeakRef.new(foo)      # reassign foo with WeakRef instance
#   p foo.to_s                  # should be same class
#   GC.start                    # start the garbage collector
#   p foo.to_s                  # should raise exception (recycled)
#
# == Example
#
# With help from WeakRef, we can implement our own redimentary WeakHash class.
#
# We will call it WeakHash, since it's really just a Hash except all of it's
# keys and values can be garbage collected.
#
#     require 'weakref'
#
#     class WeakHash < Hash
#       def []= key, obj
#         super WeakRef.new(key), WeakRef.new(obj)
#       end
#     end
#
# This is just a simple implementation, we've opened the Hash class and changed
# Hash#store to create a new WeakRef object with +key+ and +obj+ parameters
# before passing them as our key-value pair to the hash.
#
# With this you will have to limit your self to String key's, otherwise you
# will get an ArgumentError because WeakRef cannot create a finalizer for a
# Symbol. Symbols are immutable and cannot be garbage collected.
#
# Let's see it in action:
#
#   omg = "lol"
#   c = WeakHash.new
#   c['foo'] = "bar"
#   c['baz'] = Object.new
#   c['qux'] = omg
#   puts c.inspect
#   #=> {"foo"=>"bar", "baz"=>#<Object:0x007f4ddfc6cb48>, "qux"=>"lol"}
#
#   # Now run the garbage collector
#   GC.start
#   c['foo'] #=> nil
#   c['baz'] #=> nil
#   c['qux'] #=> nil
#   omg      #=> "lol"
#
#   puts c.inspect
#   #=> WeakRef::RefError: Invalid Reference - probably recycled
#
# You can see the local variable +omg+ stayed, although it's reference in our
# hash object was garbage collected, along with the rest of the keys and
# values. Also, when we tried to inspect our hash, we got a WeakRef::RefError,
# this is because these objects were also garbage collected.
