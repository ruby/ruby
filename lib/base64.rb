# = base64.rb: methods for base64-encoding and -decoding strings
#

# The Base64 module provides for the encoding (#encode64, #strict_encode64,
# #urlsafe_encode64) and decoding (#decode64, #strict_decode64,
# #urlsafe_decode64) of binary data using a Base64 representation.
#
# == Example
#
# A simple encoding and decoding.
#
#     require "base64"
#
#     enc   = Base64.encode64('Send reinforcements')
#                         # -> "U2VuZCByZWluZm9yY2VtZW50cw==\n"
#     plain = Base64.decode64(enc)
#                         # -> "Send reinforcements"
#
# The purpose of using base64 to encode data is that it translates any
# binary data into purely printable characters.

  # Alphabet'' in RFC 4648.

  # Note that the result can still contain '='.
  # You can remove the padding by setting "padding" as false.

  def urlsafe_decode64(str)
