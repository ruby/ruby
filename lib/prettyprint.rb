# frozen_string_literal: true
#
# This class implements a pretty printing algorithm. It finds line breaks and
# nice indentations for grouped structure.
#
# By default, the class assumes that primitive elements are strings and each
# byte in the strings have single column in width. But it can be used for
# other situations by giving suitable arguments for some methods:
# * newline object and space generation block for PrettyPrint.new
# * optional width argument for PrettyPrint#text
# * PrettyPrint#breakable
#
# There are several candidate uses:
# * text formatting using proportional fonts
# * multibyte characters which has columns different to number of bytes
# * non-string formatting
#
# == Bugs
# * Box based formatting?
# * Other (better) model/algorithm?

class PrettyPrint

  # This is a convenience method which is same as follows:
  #
  #   begin
  #     q = PrettyPrint.new(output, maxwidth, newline, &genspace)
  #     ...
  #     q.flush
  #     output
  #   end
  #
  def PrettyPrint.format(output=''.dup, maxwidth=79, newline="\n", genspace=lambda {|n| ' ' * n})
    q = PrettyPrint.new(output, maxwidth, newline, &genspace)
    yield q
    q.flush
    output
  end

  # This is similar to PrettyPrint::format but the result has no breaks.
  #
  # +maxwidth+, +newline+ and +genspace+ are ignored.
  #
  # The invocation of +breakable+ in the block doesn't break a line and is
  # treated as just an invocation of +text+.
  #
  def PrettyPrint.singleline_format(output=''.dup, maxwidth=nil, newline=nil, genspace=nil)
    q = SingleLine.new(output)
    yield q
    output
  end

  # Creates a buffer for pretty printing.
  #
  # +output+ is an output target. If it is not specified, '' is assumed. It
  # should have a << method which accepts the first argument +obj+ of
  # PrettyPrint#text, the first argument +sep+ of PrettyPrint#breakable, the
  # first argument +newline+ of PrettyPrint.new, and the result of a given
  # block for PrettyPrint.new.
  #
  # +maxwidth+ specifies maximum line length. If it is not specified, 79 is
  # assumed. However actual outputs may overflow +maxwidth+ if long
  # non-breakable texts are provided.
  #
  # +newline+ is used for line breaks. "\n" is used if it is not specified.
  #
  # The block is used to generate spaces. {|width| ' ' * width} is used if it
  # is not given.
  #

  attr_reader :maxwidth

  # The value that is appended to +output+ to add a new line.

  # This defaults to "\n", and should be String
  attr_reader :newline

  # A lambda or Proc, that takes one argument, of a Fixnum, and returns
  # the corresponding number of spaces.
  #
  # By default this is:
  #   lambda {|n| ' ' * n}
