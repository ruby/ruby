  #
  # Net::IMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) client
  # functionality.  The protocol is described in
  # [IMAP[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501]].
  #
  # == IMAP Overview
  #
  # An \IMAP client connects to a server, and then authenticates
  # itself using either #authenticate or #login.  Having
  # authenticated itself, there is a range of commands
  # available to it.  Most work with mailboxes, which may be
  # arranged in an hierarchical namespace, and each of which
  # contains zero or more messages.  How this is implemented on
  # the server is implementation-dependent; on a UNIX server, it
  # will frequently be implemented as files in mailbox format
  # within a hierarchy of directories.
  #
  # To work on the messages within a mailbox, the client must
  # first select that mailbox, using either #select or (for
  # read-only access) #examine.  Once the client has successfully
  # selected a mailbox, they enter _selected_ state, and that
  # mailbox becomes the _current_ mailbox, on which mail-item
  # related commands implicitly operate.
  #
  # Messages have two sorts of identifiers: message sequence
  # numbers and UIDs.
  #
  # Message sequence numbers number messages within a mailbox
  # from 1 up to the number of items in the mailbox.  If a new
  # message arrives during a session, it receives a sequence
  # number equal to the new size of the mailbox.  If messages
  # are expunged from the mailbox, remaining messages have their
  # sequence numbers "shuffled down" to fill the gaps.
  #
  # UIDs, on the other hand, are permanently guaranteed not to
  # identify another message within the same mailbox, even if
  # the existing message is deleted.  UIDs are required to
  # be assigned in ascending (but not necessarily sequential)
  # order within a mailbox; this means that if a non-IMAP client
  # rearranges the order of mailitems within a mailbox, the
  # UIDs have to be reassigned.  An \IMAP client thus cannot
  # rearrange message orders.
  #
  # == Examples of Usage
  #
  # === List sender and subject of all recent messages in the default mailbox
  #
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
  #   imap.authenticate('LOGIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
  #   imap.examine('INBOX')
  #   imap.search(["RECENT"]).each do |message_id|
  #     envelope = imap.fetch(message_id, "ENVELOPE")[0].attr["ENVELOPE"]
  #     puts "#{envelope.from[0].name}: \t#{envelope.subject}"
  #   end
  #
  # === Move all messages from April 2003 from "Mail/sent-mail" to "Mail/sent-apr03"
  #
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
  #   imap.authenticate('LOGIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
  #   imap.select('Mail/sent-mail')
  #   if not imap.list('Mail/', 'sent-apr03')
  #     imap.create('Mail/sent-apr03')
  #   end
  #   imap.search(["BEFORE", "30-Apr-2003", "SINCE", "1-Apr-2003"]).each do |message_id|
  #     imap.copy(message_id, "Mail/sent-apr03")
  #     imap.store(message_id, "+FLAGS", [:Deleted])
  #   end
  #   imap.expunge
  #
  # == Thread Safety
  #
  # Net::IMAP supports concurrent threads. For example,
  #
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new("imap.foo.net", "imap2")
  #   imap.authenticate("cram-md5", "bar", "password")
  #   imap.select("inbox")
  #   fetch_thread = Thread.start { imap.fetch(1..-1, "UID") }
  #   search_result = imap.search(["BODY", "hello"])
  #   fetch_result = fetch_thread.value
  #   imap.disconnect
  #
  # This script invokes the FETCH command and the SEARCH command concurrently.
  #
  # == Errors
  #
  # An IMAP server can send three different types of responses to indicate
  # failure:
  #
  # NO:: the attempted command could not be successfully completed.  For
  #      instance, the username/password used for logging in are incorrect;
  #      the selected mailbox does not exist; etc.
  #
  # BAD:: the request from the client does not follow the server's
  #       understanding of the IMAP protocol.  This includes attempting
  #       commands from the wrong client state; for instance, attempting
  #       to perform a SEARCH command without having SELECTed a current
  #       mailbox.  It can also signal an internal server
  #       failure (such as a disk crash) has occurred.
  #
  # BYE:: the server is saying goodbye.  This can be part of a normal
  #       logout sequence, and can be used as part of a login sequence
  #       to indicate that the server is (for some reason) unwilling
  #       to accept your connection.  As a response to any other command,
  #       it indicates either that the server is shutting down, or that
  #       the server is timing out the client connection due to inactivity.
  #
  # These three error response are represented by the errors
  # Net::IMAP::NoResponseError, Net::IMAP::BadResponseError, and
  # Net::IMAP::ByeResponseError, all of which are subclasses of
  # Net::IMAP::ResponseError.  Essentially, all methods that involve
  # sending a request to the server can generate one of these errors.
  # Only the most pertinent instances have been documented below.
  #
  # Because the IMAP class uses Sockets for communication, its methods
  # are also susceptible to the various errors that can occur when
  # working with sockets.  These are generally represented as
  # Errno errors.  For instance, any method that involves sending a
  # request to the server and/or receiving a response from it could
  # raise an Errno::EPIPE error if the network connection unexpectedly
  # goes down.  See the socket(7), ip(7), tcp(7), socket(2), connect(2),
  # and associated man pages.
  #
  # Finally, a Net::IMAP::DataFormatError is thrown if low-level data
  # is found to be in an incorrect format (for instance, when converting
  # between UTF-8 and UTF-16), and Net::IMAP::ResponseParseError is
  # thrown if a server response is non-parseable.

    # Sends an AUTHENTICATE command to authenticate the client.

    #
    #   LOGIN:: login using cleartext user and password.
    #   CRAM-MD5:: login with cleartext user and encrypted password
    #              (see [RFC-2195] for a full description).  This
    #              mechanism requires that the server have the user's
    #              password stored in clear-text password.
    #
    # For both of these mechanisms, there should be two +args+: username
    # and (cleartext) password.  A server may not support one or the other
    # of these mechanisms; check #capability for a capability of

    #
    # Authentication is done using the appropriate authenticator object:
    # see +add_authenticator+ for more information on plugging in your own
    # authenticator.

    #    imap.authenticate('LOGIN', user, password)

    # Sends a NAMESPACE command and returns the namespaces that are available.
    # The NAMESPACE command allows a client to discover the prefixes of
    # namespaces used by a server for personal mailboxes, other users'
    # mailboxes, and shared mailboxes.
    #
    # The NAMESPACE extension predates [IMAP4rev1[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2501]],
    # so most IMAP servers support it. Many popular IMAP servers are configured
    # with the default personal namespaces as `("" "/")`: no prefix and "/"
    # hierarchy delimiter. In that common case, the naive client may not have
    # any trouble naming mailboxes.
    #
    # But many servers are configured with the default personal namespace as
    # e.g. `("INBOX." ".")`, placing all personal folders under INBOX, with "."
    # as the hierarchy delimiter. If the client does not check for this, but
    # naively assumes it can use the same folder names for all servers, then
    # folder creation (and listing, moving, etc) can lead to errors.
    #
    # From RFC2342:
    #
    #    Although typically a server will support only a single Personal
    #    Namespace, and a single Other User's Namespace, circumstances exist
    #    where there MAY be multiples of these, and a client MUST be prepared
    #    for them. If a client is configured such that it is required to create
    #    a certain mailbox, there can be circumstances where it is unclear which
    #    Personal Namespaces it should create the mailbox in. In these
