# == Overview
#
# dRuby is a distributed object system for Ruby.  It allows an object in one
# Ruby process to invoke methods on an object in another Ruby process on the
# same or a different machine.
#
# The Ruby standard library contains the core classes of the dRuby package.
# However, the full package also includes access control lists and the
# Rinda tuple-space distributed task management system, as well as a
# large number of samples.  The full dRuby package can be downloaded from
# the dRuby home page (see *References*).
#
# For an introduction and examples of usage see the documentation to the
# DRb module.

#
# == Overview
#
# dRuby is a distributed object system for Ruby.  It is written in
# pure Ruby and uses its own protocol.  No add-in services are needed
# beyond those provided by the Ruby runtime, such as TCP sockets.  It
# does not rely on or interoperate with other distributed object
# systems such as CORBA, RMI, or .NET.
#
# dRuby allows methods to be called in one Ruby process upon a Ruby
# object located in another Ruby process, even on another machine.
# References to objects can be passed between processes.  Method
# arguments and return values are dumped and loaded in marshalled
# format.  All of this is done transparently to both the caller of the
# remote method and the object that it is called upon.
#
# An object in a remote process is locally represented by a
# DRb::DRbObject instance.  This acts as a sort of proxy for the
# remote object.  Methods called upon this DRbObject instance are
# forwarded to its remote object.  This is arranged dynamically at run
# time.  There are no statically declared interfaces for remote
# objects, such as CORBA's IDL.
#
# dRuby calls made into a process are handled by a DRb::DRbServer
# instance within that process.  This reconstitutes the method call,
# invokes it upon the specified local object, and returns the value to
# the remote caller.  Any object can receive calls over dRuby.  There
# is no need to implement a special interface, or mixin special
# functionality.  Nor, in the general case, does an object need to
# explicitly register itself with a DRbServer in order to receive
# dRuby calls.
#
# One process wishing to make dRuby calls upon another process must
# somehow obtain an initial reference to an object in the remote
# process by some means other than as the return value of a remote
# method call, as there is initially no remote object reference it can
# invoke a method upon.  This is done by attaching to the server by
# URI.  Each DRbServer binds itself to a URI such as
# 'druby://example.com:8787'.  A DRbServer can have an object attached
# to it that acts as the server's *front* *object*.  A DRbObject can
# be explicitly created from the server's URI.  This DRbObject's
# remote object will be the server's front object.  This front object
# can then return references to other Ruby objects in the DRbServer's
# process.
#
# Method calls made over dRuby behave largely the same as normal Ruby
# method calls made within a process.  Method calls with blocks are
# supported, as are raising exceptions.  In addition to a method's
# standard errors, a dRuby call may also raise one of the
# dRuby-specific errors, all of which are subclasses of DRb::DRbError.
#
# Any type of object can be passed as an argument to a dRuby call or
# returned as its return value.  By default, such objects are dumped
# or marshalled at the local end, then loaded or unmarshalled at the
# remote end.  The remote end therefore receives a copy of the local
# object, not a distributed reference to it; methods invoked upon this
# copy are executed entirely in the remote process, not passed on to
# the local original.  This has semantics similar to pass-by-value.
#
# However, if an object cannot be marshalled, a dRuby reference to it
# is passed or returned instead.  This will turn up at the remote end
# as a DRbObject instance.  All methods invoked upon this remote proxy
# are forwarded to the local object, as described in the discussion of
# DRbObjects.  This has semantics similar to the normal Ruby
# pass-by-reference.
#
# The easiest way to signal that we want an otherwise marshallable
# object to be passed or returned as a DRbObject reference, rather
# than marshalled and sent as a copy, is to include the
# DRb::DRbUndumped mixin module.
#
# dRuby supports calling remote methods with blocks.  As blocks (or
# rather the Proc objects that represent them) are not marshallable,
# the block executes in the local, not the remote, context.  Each
# value yielded to the block is passed from the remote object to the
# local block, then the value returned by each block invocation is
# passed back to the remote execution context to be collected, before
# the collected values are finally returned to the local context as
# the return value of the method invocation.
#
# == Examples of usage
#
# For more dRuby samples, see the +samples+ directory in the full
# dRuby distribution.
#
# === dRuby in client/server mode
#
# This illustrates setting up a simple client-server drb
# system.  Run the server and client code in different terminals,
# starting the server code first.
#
# ==== Server code
#
#   require 'drb/drb'
#
#   # The URI for the server to connect to
#   URI="druby://localhost:8787"
#
#   class TimeServer
#
#     def get_current_time
#       return Time.now
#     end
#
#   end
#
#   # The object that handles requests on the server
#   FRONT_OBJECT=TimeServer.new
#
#   $SAFE = 1   # disable eval() and friends
#
#   DRb.start_service(URI, FRONT_OBJECT)
#   # Wait for the drb server thread to finish before exiting.
#   DRb.thread.join
#
# ==== Client code
#
#   require 'drb/drb'
#
#   # The URI to connect to
#   SERVER_URI="druby://localhost:8787"
#
#   # Start a local DRbServer to handle callbacks.
#   #
#   # Not necessary for this small example, but will be required
#   # as soon as we pass a non-marshallable object as an argument
#   # to a dRuby call.
#   #
#   # Note: this must be called at least once per process to take any effect.
#   # This is particularly important if your application forks.
#   DRb.start_service
#
#   timeserver = DRbObject.new_with_uri(SERVER_URI)
#   puts timeserver.get_current_time
#
# === Remote objects under dRuby
#
# This example illustrates returning a reference to an object
# from a dRuby call.  The Logger instances live in the server
# process.  References to them are returned to the client process,
# where methods can be invoked upon them.  These methods are
# executed in the server process.
#
# ==== Server code
#
#   require 'drb/drb'
#
#   URI="druby://localhost:8787"
#
#   class Logger
#
#       # Make dRuby send Logger instances as dRuby references,
#       # not copies.
#       include DRb::DRbUndumped
#
#       def initialize(n, fname)
#           @name = n
#           @filename = fname
#       end
#
#       def log(message)
#           File.open(@filename, "a") do |f|
#               f.puts("#{Time.now}: #{@name}: #{message}")
#           end
#       end
#
#   end
#
#   # We have a central object for creating and retrieving loggers.
#   # This retains a local reference to all loggers created.  This
#   # is so an existing logger can be looked up by name, but also
#   # to prevent loggers from being garbage collected.  A dRuby
#   # reference to an object is not sufficient to prevent it being
#   # garbage collected!
#   class LoggerFactory
#
#       def initialize(bdir)
#           @basedir = bdir
#           @loggers = {}
#       end
#
#       def get_logger(name)
#           if !@loggers.has_key? name
#               # make the filename safe, then declare it to be so
#               fname = name.gsub(/[.\/\\\:]/, "_").untaint
#               @loggers[name] = Logger.new(name, @basedir + "/" + fname)
#           end
#           return @loggers[name]
#       end
#
#   end
#
#   FRONT_OBJECT=LoggerFactory.new("/tmp/dlog")
#
#   $SAFE = 1   # disable eval() and friends
#
#   DRb.start_service(URI, FRONT_OBJECT)
#   DRb.thread.join
#
# ==== Client code
#
#   require 'drb/drb'
#
#   SERVER_URI="druby://localhost:8787"
#
#   DRb.start_service
#
#   log_service=DRbObject.new_with_uri(SERVER_URI)
#
#   ["loga", "logb", "logc"].each do |logname|
#
#       logger=log_service.get_logger(logname)
#
#       logger.log("Hello, world!")
#       logger.log("Goodbye, world!")
#       logger.log("=== EOT ===")
#
#   end
#
# == Security
#
# As with all network services, security needs to be considered when
# using dRuby.  By allowing external access to a Ruby object, you are
# not only allowing outside clients to call the methods you have
# defined for that object, but by default to execute arbitrary Ruby
# code on your server.  Consider the following:
#
#    # !!! UNSAFE CODE !!!
#    ro = DRbObject::new_with_uri("druby://your.server.com:8989")
#    class << ro
#      undef :instance_eval  # force call to be passed to remote object
#    end
#    ro.instance_eval("`rm -rf *`")
#
# The dangers posed by instance_eval and friends are such that a
# DRbServer should generally be run with $SAFE set to at least
# level 1.  This will disable eval() and related calls on strings
# passed across the wire.  The sample usage code given above follows
# this practice.
#
# A DRbServer can be configured with an access control list to
# selectively allow or deny access from specified IP addresses.  The
# main druby distribution provides the ACL class for this purpose.  In
# general, this mechanism should only be used alongside, rather than
# as a replacement for, a good firewall.
#
# == dRuby internals
#
# dRuby is implemented using three main components: a remote method
# call marshaller/unmarshaller; a transport protocol; and an
# ID-to-object mapper.  The latter two can be directly, and the first
# indirectly, replaced, in order to provide different behaviour and
# capabilities.
#
# Marshalling and unmarshalling of remote method calls is performed by
# a DRb::DRbMessage instance.  This uses the Marshal module to dump
# the method call before sending it over the transport layer, then
# reconstitute it at the other end.  There is normally no need to
# replace this component, and no direct way is provided to do so.
# However, it is possible to implement an alternative marshalling
# scheme as part of an implementation of the transport layer.
#
# The transport layer is responsible for opening client and server
# network connections and forwarding dRuby request across them.
# Normally, it uses DRb::DRbMessage internally to manage marshalling
# and unmarshalling.  The transport layer is managed by
# DRb::DRbProtocol.  Multiple protocols can be installed in
# DRbProtocol at the one time; selection between them is determined by
# the scheme of a dRuby URI.  The default transport protocol is
# selected by the scheme 'druby:', and implemented by
# DRb::DRbTCPSocket.  This uses plain TCP/IP sockets for
# communication.  An alternative protocol, using UNIX domain sockets,
# is implemented by DRb::DRbUNIXSocket in the file drb/unix.rb, and
# selected by the scheme 'drbunix:'.  A sample implementation over
# HTTP can be found in the samples accompanying the main dRuby
# distribution.
#
# The ID-to-object mapping component maps dRuby object ids to the
# objects they refer to, and vice versa.  The implementation to use
# can be specified as part of a DRb::DRbServer's configuration.  The
# default implementation is provided by DRb::DRbIdConv.  It uses an
# object's ObjectSpace id as its dRuby id.  This means that the dRuby
# reference to that object only remains meaningful for the lifetime of
# the object's process and the lifetime of the object within that
# process.  A modified implementation is provided by DRb::TimerIdConv
# in the file drb/timeridconv.rb.  This implementation retains a local
# reference to all objects exported over dRuby for a configurable
# period of time (defaulting to ten minutes), to prevent them being
# garbage-collected within this time.  Another sample implementation
# is provided in sample/name.rb in the main dRuby distribution.  This
# allows objects to specify their own id or "name".  A dRuby reference
# can be made persistent across processes by having each process
# register an object using the same dRuby name.

  # Module managing the underlying network protocol(s) used by drb.
  #
  # By default, drb uses the DRbTCPSocket protocol.  Other protocols
  # can be defined.  A protocol must define the following class methods:
  #
  #   [open(uri, config)] Open a client connection to the server at +uri+,
  #                       using configuration +config+.  Return a protocol
  #                       instance for this connection.
  #   [open_server(uri, config)] Open a server listening at +uri+,
  #                              using configuration +config+.  Return a
  #                              protocol instance for this listener.
  #   [uri_option(uri, config)] Take a URI, possibly containing an option
  #                             component (e.g. a trailing '?param=val'),
  #                             and return a [uri, option] tuple.
  #
  # All of these methods should raise a DRbBadScheme error if the URI
  # does not identify the protocol they support (e.g. "druby:" for
  # the standard Ruby protocol).  This is how the DRbProtocol module,
  # given a URI, determines which protocol implementation serves that
  # protocol.
  #
  # The protocol instance returned by #open_server must have the
  # following methods:
  #
  # [accept] Accept a new connection to the server.  Returns a protocol
  #          instance capable of communicating with the client.
  # [close] Close the server connection.
  # [uri] Get the URI for this server.
  #
  # The protocol instance returned by #open must have the following methods:
  #
  # [send_request (ref, msg_id, arg, b)]
  #      Send a request to +ref+ with the given message id and arguments.
  #      This is most easily implemented by calling DRbMessage.send_request,
  #      providing a stream that sits on top of the current protocol.
  # [recv_reply]
  #      Receive a reply from the server and return it as a [success-boolean,
  #      reply-value] pair.  This is most easily implemented by calling
  #      DRb.recv_reply, providing a stream that sits on top of the
  #      current protocol.
  # [alive?]
  #      Is this connection still alive?
  # [close]
  #      Close this connection.
  #
  # The protocol instance returned by #open_server().accept() must have
  # the following methods:
  #
  # [recv_request]
  #     Receive a request from the client and return a [object, message,
  #     args, block] tuple.  This is most easily implemented by calling
  #     DRbMessage.recv_request, providing a stream that sits on top of
  #     the current protocol.
  # [send_reply(succ, result)]
  #     Send a reply to the client.  This is most easily implemented
  #     by calling DRbMessage.send_reply, providing a stream that sits
  #     on top of the current protocol.
  # [close]
  #     Close this connection.
  #
  # A new protocol is registered with the DRbProtocol module using
  # the add_protocol method.
  #
  # For examples of other protocols, see DRbUNIXSocket in drb/unix.rb,
  # and HTTP0 in sample/http0.rb and sample/http0serv.rb in the full
  # drb distribution.

    #             in the server will be logged to $stdout. false
    #             by default.
    # :tcp_acl :: the access control list for this server.  See
    #             the ACL class from the main dRuby distribution.
    # :load_limit :: the maximum message size in bytes accepted by
    #                the server.  Defaults to 25 MB (26214400).
    # :argc_limit :: the maximum number of arguments to a remote
    #                method accepted by the server.  Defaults to
    #                256.
    # :safe_level :: The safe level of the DRbServer.  The attribute
