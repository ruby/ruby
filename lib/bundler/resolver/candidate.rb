    #
    # This class is a PubGrub compatible "Version" class that takes Bundler
    # resolution complexities into account.
    #
    # Each Resolver::Candidate has a underlying `Gem::Version` plus a set of
    # platforms. For example, 1.1.0-x86_64-linux is a different resolution candidate
    # from 1.1.0 (generic). This is because different platform variants of the
    # same gem version can bring different dependencies, so they need to be
    # considered separately.
    #
    # Some candidates may also keep some information explicitly about the
    # package they refer to. These candidates are referred to as "canonical" and
    # are used when materializing resolution results back into RubyGems
    # specifications that can be installed, written to lock files, and so on.
