# Persistent connections for Gem::Net::HTTP
#
# Gem::Net::HTTP::Persistent maintains persistent connections across all the
# servers you wish to talk to.  For each host:port you communicate with a
# single persistent connection is created.
#
# Connections will be shared across threads through a connection pool to
# increase reuse of connections.
#
# You can shut down any remaining HTTP connections when done by calling
# #shutdown.
#
# Example:
#
#   require 'bundler/vendor/net-http-persistent/lib/net/http/persistent'
#
#   uri = Gem::URI 'http://example.com/awesome/web/service'
#
#   http = Gem::Net::HTTP::Persistent.new
#
#   # perform a GET
#   response = http.request uri
#
#   # or
#
#   get = Gem::Net::HTTP::Get.new uri.request_uri
#   response = http.request get
#
#   # create a POST
#   post_uri = uri + 'create'
#   post = Gem::Net::HTTP::Post.new post_uri.path
#   post.set_form_data 'some' => 'cool data'
#
#   # perform the POST, the Gem::URI is always required
#   response http.request post_uri, post
#
# Note that for GET, HEAD and other requests that do not have a body you want
# to use Gem::URI#request_uri not Gem::URI#path.  The request_uri contains the query
# params which are sent in the body for other requests.
#
# == TLS/SSL
#
# TLS connections are automatically created depending upon the scheme of the
# Gem::URI.  TLS connections are automatically verified against the default
# certificate store for your computer.  You can override this by changing
# verify_mode or by specifying an alternate cert_store.
#
# Here are the TLS settings, see the individual methods for documentation:
#
# #certificate        :: This client's certificate
# #ca_file            :: The certificate-authorities
# #ca_path            :: Directory with certificate-authorities
# #cert_store         :: An SSL certificate store
# #ciphers            :: List of SSl ciphers allowed
# #private_key        :: The client's SSL private key
# #reuse_ssl_sessions :: Reuse a previously opened SSL session for a new
#                        connection
# #ssl_timeout        :: Session lifetime
# #ssl_version        :: Which specific SSL version to use
# #verify_callback    :: For server certificate verification
# #verify_depth       :: Depth of certificate verification
# #verify_mode        :: How connections should be verified
# #verify_hostname    :: Use hostname verification for server certificate
#                        during the handshake
#
# == Proxies
#
# A proxy can be set through #proxy= or at initialization time by providing a
# second argument to ::new.  The proxy may be the Gem::URI of the proxy server or
# <code>:ENV</code> which will consult environment variables.
#
# See #proxy= and #proxy_from_env for details.
#
# == Headers
#
# Headers may be specified for use in every request.  #headers are appended to
# any headers on the request.  #override_headers replace existing headers on
# the request.
#
# The difference between the two can be seen in setting the User-Agent.  Using
# <code>http.headers['User-Agent'] = 'MyUserAgent'</code> will send "Ruby,
# MyUserAgent" while <code>http.override_headers['User-Agent'] =
# 'MyUserAgent'</code> will send "MyUserAgent".
#
# == Tuning
#
# === Segregation
#
# Each Gem::Net::HTTP::Persistent instance has its own pool of connections.  There
# is no sharing with other instances (as was true in earlier versions).
#
# === Idle Timeout
#
# If a connection hasn't been used for this number of seconds it will
# automatically be reset upon the next use to avoid attempting to send to a
# closed connection.  The default value is 5 seconds. nil means no timeout.
# Set through #idle_timeout.
#
# Reducing this value may help avoid the "too many connection resets" error
# when sending non-idempotent requests while increasing this value will cause
# fewer round-trips.
#
# === Read Timeout
#
# The amount of time allowed between reading two chunks from the socket.  Set
# through #read_timeout
#
# === Max Requests
#
# The number of requests that should be made before opening a new connection.
# Typically many keep-alive capable servers tune this to 100 or less, so the
# 101st request will fail with ECONNRESET. If unset (default), this value has
# no effect, if set, connections will be reset on the request after
# max_requests.
#
# === Open Timeout
#
# The amount of time to wait for a connection to be opened.  Set through
# #open_timeout.
#
# === Socket Options
#
# Socket options may be set on newly-created connections.  See #socket_options
# for details.
#
# === Connection Termination
#
# If you are done using the Gem::Net::HTTP::Persistent instance you may shut down
# all the connections in the current thread with #shutdown.  This is not
# recommended for normal use, it should only be used when it will be several
# minutes before you make another HTTP request.
#
# If you are using multiple threads, call #shutdown in each thread when the
# thread is done making requests.  If you don't call shutdown, that's OK.
# Ruby will automatically garbage collect and shutdown your HTTP connections
# when the thread terminates.

                             !!!SECURITY WARNING!!!

The SSL HTTP connection to:

  #{connection.address}:#{connection.port}

                           !!!MAY NOT BE VERIFIED!!!

On your platform your OpenSSL implementation is broken.

There is no difference between the values of VERIFY_NONE and VERIFY_PEER.

This means that attempting to verify the security of SSL connections may not
work.  This exposes you to man-in-the-middle exploits, snooping on the
contents of your connection and other dangers to the security of your data.

To disable this warning define the following constant at top-level in your
application:

  I_KNOW_THAT_OPENSSL_VERIFY_PEER_EQUALS_VERIFY_NONE_IS_WRONG = nil
