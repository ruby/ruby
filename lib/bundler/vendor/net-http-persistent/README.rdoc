== DESCRIPTION:

Manages persistent connections using Net::HTTP including a thread pool for
connecting to multiple hosts.

Using persistent HTTP connections can dramatically increase the speed of HTTP.
Creating a new HTTP connection for every request involves an extra TCP
round-trip and causes TCP congestion avoidance negotiation to start over.

Net::HTTP supports persistent connections with some API methods but does not
make setting up a single persistent connection or managing multiple
connections easy.  Net::HTTP::Persistent wraps Net::HTTP and allows you to
focus on how to make HTTP requests.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Supports TLS with secure defaults
* Thread-safe
* Pure ruby

== SYNOPSIS

The following example will make two requests to the same server.  The
connection is kept alive between requests:

    require 'net/http/persistent'

    uri = URI 'http://example.com/awesome/web/service'

    http = Net::HTTP::Persistent.new name: 'my_app_name'

    # perform a GET
    response = http.request uri

    # create a POST
    post_uri = uri + 'create'
    post = Net::HTTP::Post.new post_uri.path
    post.set_form_data 'some' => 'cool data'

    # perform the POST, the URI is always required
    response = http.request post_uri, post

    # if you are done making http requests, or won't make requests for several
    # minutes
    http.shutdown

Please see the documentation on Net::HTTP::Persistent for more information,
including SSL connection verification, header handling and tunable options.
