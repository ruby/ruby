module Bundler
  # This class contains all of the logic for determining the next version of a
  # Gem to update to based on the requested level (patch, minor, major).
  # Primarily designed to work with Resolver which will provide it the list of
  # available dependency versions as found in its index, before returning it to
  # to the resolution engine to select the best version.
  class GemVersionPromoter
    attr_reader :level
    attr_accessor :pre

    # By default, strict is false, meaning every available version of a gem
    # is returned from sort_versions. The order gives preference to the
    # requested level (:patch, :minor, :major) but in complicated requirement
    # cases some gems will by necessity be promoted past the requested level,
    # or even reverted to older versions.
    #
    # If strict is set to true, the results from sort_versions will be
    # truncated, eliminating any version outside the current level scope.
    # This can lead to unexpected outcomes or even VersionConflict exceptions
    # that report a version of a gem not existing for versions that indeed do
    # existing in the referenced source.
