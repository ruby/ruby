.TH "BUNDLE\-BINSTUBS" "1" "March 2022" "" ""
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBbundle\-binstubs\fR \- Install the binstubs of the listed gems
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbundle binstubs\fR \fIGEM_NAME\fR [\-\-force] [\-\-path PATH] [\-\-standalone]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Binstubs are scripts that wrap around executables\. Bundler creates a small Ruby file (a binstub) that loads Bundler, runs the command, and puts it into \fBbin/\fR\. Binstubs are a shortcut\-or alternative\- to always using \fBbundle exec\fR\. This gives you a file that can be run directly, and one that will always run the correct gem version used by the application\.
.
.P
For example, if you run \fBbundle binstubs rspec\-core\fR, Bundler will create the file \fBbin/rspec\fR\. That file will contain enough code to load Bundler, tell it to load the bundled gems, and then run rspec\.
.
.P
This command generates binstubs for executables in \fBGEM_NAME\fR\. Binstubs are put into \fBbin\fR, or the \fB\-\-path\fR directory if one has been set\. Calling binstubs with [GEM [GEM]] will create binstubs for all given gems\.

.
.TP
\fB\-\-all\fR
Create binstubs for all gems in the bundle\.
