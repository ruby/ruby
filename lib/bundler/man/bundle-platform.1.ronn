bundle-platform(1) -- Displays platform compatibility information
=================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`bundle platform` [--ruby]

## DESCRIPTION

`platform` displays information from your Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, and Ruby
VM about your platform.

For instance, using this Gemfile(5):

    source "https://rubygems.org"

    ruby "3.1.2"

    gem "rack"

If you run `bundle platform` on Ruby 3.1.2, it displays the following output:

    Your platform is: x86_64-linux

    Your app has gems that work on these platforms:
    * arm64-darwin-21
    * ruby
    * x64-mingw-ucrt
    * x86_64-linux

    Your Gemfile specifies a Ruby version requirement:
    * ruby 3.1.2

    Your current platform satisfies the Ruby version requirement.

`platform` lists all the platforms in your `Gemfile.lock` as well as the
`ruby` directive if applicable from your Gemfile(5). It also lets you know
if the `ruby` directive requirement has been met. If `ruby` directive doesn't
match the running Ruby VM, it tells you what part does not.

## OPTIONS

* `--ruby`:
  It will display the ruby directive information, so you don't have to
  parse it from the Gemfile(5).
