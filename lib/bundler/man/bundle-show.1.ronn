=========================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`bundle show` [GEM]

## DESCRIPTION

Without the [GEM] option, `show` will print a list of the names and versions of
all gems that are required by your [`Gemfile(5)`][Gemfile(5)], sorted by name.

Calling show with [GEM] will list the exact location of that gem on your
machine.

## OPTIONS

* `--paths`:
  List the paths of all gems that are required by your [`Gemfile(5)`][Gemfile(5)],
  sorted by gem name.
