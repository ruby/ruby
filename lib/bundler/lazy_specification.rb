    # NOTE: Rubygems default requirement is ">= 0", which doesn't match
    # prereleases of 0 versions, like "0.0.0.dev" or "0.0.0.SNAPSHOT". However,
    # bundler users expect those to work. We need to make sure that Gemfile
    # dependencies without explicit requirements (which use ">= 0" under the
    # hood by default) are still valid for locked specs using this kind of
    # versions. The method implements an ad-hoc fix for that. A better solution
    # might be to change default rubygems requirement of dependencies to be ">=
    # 0.A" but that's a major refactoring likely to break things. Hopefully we
    # can attempt it in the future.
