# ## IRB
#
# Module IRB ("Interactive Ruby") provides a shell-like interface that supports
# user interaction with the Ruby interpreter.
#
# It operates as a *read-eval-print loop*
# ([REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop))
# that:
#
# *   ***Reads*** each character as you type. You can modify the IRB context to
#     change the way input works. See [Input](rdoc-ref:IRB@Input).
# *   ***Evaluates*** the code each time it has read a syntactically complete
#     passage.
# *   ***Prints*** after evaluating. You can modify the IRB context to change
#     the way output works. See [Output](rdoc-ref:IRB@Output).
#
#
# Example:
#
#     $ irb
#     irb(main):001> File.basename(Dir.pwd)
#     => "irb"
#     irb(main):002> Dir.entries('.').size
#     => 25
#     irb(main):003* Dir.entries('.').select do |entry|
#     irb(main):004*   entry.start_with?('R')
#     irb(main):005> end
#     => ["README.md", "Rakefile"]
#
# The typed input may also include [\IRB-specific
# commands](rdoc-ref:IRB@IRB-Specific+Commands).
#
# As seen above, you can start IRB by using the shell command `irb`.
#
# You can stop an IRB session by typing command `exit`:
#
#     irb(main):006> exit
#     $
#
# At that point, IRB calls any hooks found in array `IRB.conf[:AT_EXIT]`, then
# exits.
#
# ## Startup
#
# At startup, IRB:
#
# 1.  Interprets (as Ruby code) the content of the [configuration
#     file](rdoc-ref:IRB@Configuration+File) (if given).
# 2.  Constructs the initial session context from [hash
#     IRB.conf](rdoc-ref:IRB@Hash+IRB.conf) and from default values; the hash
#     content may have been affected by [command-line
#     options](rdoc-ref:IB@Command-Line+Options), and by direct assignments in
#     the configuration file.
# 3.  Assigns the context to variable `conf`.
# 4.  Assigns command-line arguments to variable `ARGV`.
# 5.  Prints the [prompt](rdoc-ref:IRB@Prompt+and+Return+Formats).
# 6.  Puts the content of the [initialization
#     script](rdoc-ref:IRB@Initialization+Script) onto the IRB shell, just as if
#     it were user-typed commands.
#
#
# ### The Command Line
#
# On the command line, all options precede all arguments; the first item that is
# not recognized as an option is treated as an argument, as are all items that
# follow.
#
# #### Command-Line Options
#
# Many command-line options affect entries in hash `IRB.conf`, which in turn
# affect the initial configuration of the IRB session.
#
# Details of the options are described in the relevant subsections below.
#
# A cursory list of the IRB command-line options may be seen in the [help
# message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruby/irb/master/lib/irb/lc/help-message),
# which is also displayed if you use command-line option `--help`.
#
# If you are interested in a specific option, consult the
# [index](rdoc-ref:doc/irb/indexes.md@Index+of+Command-Line+Options).
#
# #### Command-Line Arguments
#
# Command-line arguments are passed to IRB in array `ARGV`:
#
#     $ irb --noscript Foo Bar Baz
#     irb(main):001> ARGV
#     => ["Foo", "Bar", "Baz"]
#     irb(main):002> exit
#     $
#
# Command-line option `--` causes everything that follows to be treated as
# arguments, even those that look like options:
#
#     $ irb --noscript -- --noscript -- Foo Bar Baz
#     irb(main):001> ARGV
#     => ["--noscript", "--", "Foo", "Bar", "Baz"]
#     irb(main):002> exit
#     $
#
# ### Configuration File
#
# You can initialize IRB via a *configuration file*.
#
# If command-line option `-f` is given, no configuration file is looked for.
#
# Otherwise, IRB reads and interprets a configuration file if one is available.
#
# The configuration file can contain any Ruby code, and can usefully include
# user code that:
#
# *   Can then be debugged in IRB.
# *   Configures IRB itself.
# *   Requires or loads files.
#
#
# The path to the configuration file is the first found among:
#
# *   The value of variable `$IRBRC`, if defined.
# *   The value of variable `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/irb/irbrc`, if defined.
# *   File `$HOME/.irbrc`, if it exists.
# *   File `$HOME/.config/irb/irbrc`, if it exists.
# *   File `.irbrc` in the current directory, if it exists.
# *   File `irb.rc` in the current directory, if it exists.
# *   File `_irbrc` in the current directory, if it exists.
# *   File `$irbrc` in the current directory, if it exists.
#
#
# If the search fails, there is no configuration file.
#
# If the search succeeds, the configuration file is read as Ruby code, and so
# can contain any Ruby programming you like.
#
# Method `conf.rc?` returns `true` if a configuration file was read, `false`
# otherwise. Hash entry `IRB.conf[:RC]` also contains that value.
#
# ### Hash `IRB.conf`
#
# The initial entries in hash `IRB.conf` are determined by:
#
# *   Default values.
# *   Command-line options, which may override defaults.
# *   Direct assignments in the configuration file.
#
#
# You can see the hash by typing `IRB.conf`.
#
# Details of the entries' meanings are described in the relevant subsections
# below.
#
# If you are interested in a specific entry, consult the
# [index](rdoc-ref:doc/irb/indexes.md@Index+of+IRB.conf+Entries).
#
# ### Notes on Initialization Precedence
#
# *   Any conflict between an entry in hash `IRB.conf` and a command-line option
#     is resolved in favor of the hash entry.
# *   Hash `IRB.conf` affects the context only once, when the configuration file
#     is interpreted; any subsequent changes to it do not affect the context and
#     are therefore essentially meaningless.
#
#
# ### Initialization Script
#
# By default, the first command-line argument (after any options) is the path to
# a Ruby initialization script.
#
# IRB reads the initialization script and puts its content onto the IRB shell,
# just as if it were user-typed commands.
#
# Command-line option `--noscript` causes the first command-line argument to be
# treated as an ordinary argument (instead of an initialization script);
# `--script` is the default.
#
# ## Input
#
# This section describes the features that allow you to change the way IRB input
# works; see also [Input and Output](rdoc-ref:IRB@Input+and+Output).
#
# ### Input Command History
#
# By default, IRB stores a history of up to 1000 input commands in a file named
# `.irb_history`. The history file will be in the same directory as the
# [configuration file](rdoc-ref:IRB@Configuration+File) if one is found, or in
# `~/` otherwise.
#
# A new IRB session creates the history file if it does not exist, and appends
# to the file if it does exist.
#
# You can change the filepath by adding to your configuration file:
# `IRB.conf[:HISTORY_FILE] = *filepath*`, where *filepath* is a string filepath.
#
# During the session, method `conf.history_file` returns the filepath, and
# method `conf.history_file = *new_filepath*` copies the history to the file at
# *new_filepath*, which becomes the history file for the session.
#
# You can change the number of commands saved by adding to your configuration
# file: `IRB.conf[:SAVE_HISTORY] = *n*`, wheHISTORY_FILEre *n* is one of:
#
# *   Positive integer: the number of commands to be saved,
# *   Zero: all commands are to be saved.
# *   `nil`: no commands are to be saved,.
#
#
# During the session, you can use methods `conf.save_history` or
# `conf.save_history=` to retrieve or change the count.
#
# ### Command Aliases
#
# By default, IRB defines several command aliases:
#
#     irb(main):001> conf.command_aliases
#     => {:"$"=>:show_source, :"@"=>:whereami}
#
# You can change the initial aliases in the configuration file with:
#
#     IRB.conf[:COMMAND_ALIASES] = {foo: :show_source, bar: :whereami}
#
# You can replace the current aliases at any time with configuration method
# `conf.command_aliases=`; Because `conf.command_aliases` is a hash, you can
# modify it.
#
# ### End-of-File
#
# By default, `IRB.conf[:IGNORE_EOF]` is `false`, which means that typing the
# end-of-file character `Ctrl-D` causes the session to exit.
#
# You can reverse that behavior by adding `IRB.conf[:IGNORE_EOF] = true` to the
# configuration file.
#
# During the session, method `conf.ignore_eof?` returns the setting, and method
# `conf.ignore_eof = *boolean*` sets it.
#
# ### SIGINT
#
# By default, `IRB.conf[:IGNORE_SIGINT]` is `true`, which means that typing the
# interrupt character `Ctrl-C` causes the session to exit.
#
# You can reverse that behavior by adding `IRB.conf[:IGNORE_SIGING] = false` to
# the configuration file.
#
# During the session, method `conf.ignore_siging?` returns the setting, and
# method `conf.ignore_sigint = *boolean*` sets it.
#
# ### Automatic Completion
#
# By default, IRB enables [automatic
# completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete#In_command-line_interpr
# eters):
#
# You can disable it by either of these:
#
# *   Adding `IRB.conf[:USE_AUTOCOMPLETE] = false` to the configuration file.
# *   Giving command-line option `--noautocomplete` (`--autocomplete` is the
#     default).
#
#
# Method `conf.use_autocomplete?` returns `true` if automatic completion is
# enabled, `false` otherwise.
#
# The setting may not be changed during the session.
#
# ### Automatic Indentation
#
# By default, IRB automatically indents lines of code to show structure (e.g.,
# it indent the contents of a block).
#
# The current setting is returned by the configuration method
# `conf.auto_indent_mode`.
#
# The default initial setting is `true`:
#
#     irb(main):001> conf.auto_indent_mode
#     => true
#     irb(main):002* Dir.entries('.').select do |entry|
#     irb(main):003*   entry.start_with?('R')
#     irb(main):004> end
#     => ["README.md", "Rakefile"]
#
# You can change the initial setting in the configuration file with:
#
#     IRB.conf[:AUTO_INDENT] = false
#
# Note that the *current* setting *may not* be changed in the IRB session.
#
# ### Input Method
#
# The IRB input method determines how command input is to be read; by default,
# the input method for a session is IRB::RelineInputMethod.
#
# You can set the input method by:
#
# *   Adding to the configuration file:
#
#     *   `IRB.conf[:USE_SINGLELINE] = true` or `IRB.conf[:USE_MULTILINE]=
#         false` sets the input method to IRB::ReadlineInputMethod.
#     *   `IRB.conf[:USE_SINGLELINE] = false` or `IRB.conf[:USE_MULTILINE] =
#         true` sets the input method to IRB::RelineInputMethod.
#
#
# *   Giving command-line options:
#
#     *   `--singleline` or `--nomultiline` sets the input method to
#         IRB::ReadlineInputMethod.
#     *   `--nosingleline` or `--multiline` sets the input method to
#         IRB::RelineInputMethod.
#
#
#
# Method `conf.use_multiline?` and its synonym `conf.use_reline` return:
#
# *   `true` if option `--multiline` was given.
# *   `false` if option `--nomultiline` was given.
# *   `nil` if neither was given.
#
#
# Method `conf.use_singleline?` and its synonym `conf.use_readline` return:
#
# *   `true` if option `--singleline` was given.
# *   `false` if option `--nosingleline` was given.
# *   `nil` if neither was given.
#
#
# ## Output
#
# This section describes the features that allow you to change the way IRB
# output works; see also [Input and Output](rdoc-ref:IRB@Input+and+Output).
#
# ### Return-Value Printing (Echoing)
#
# By default, IRB prints (echoes) the values returned by all input commands.
#
# You can change the initial behavior and suppress all echoing by:
#
# *   Adding to the configuration file: `IRB.conf[:ECHO] = false`. (The default
#     value for this entry is `nil`, which means the same as `true`.)
# *   Giving command-line option `--noecho`. (The default is `--echo`.)
#
#
# During the session, you can change the current setting with configuration
# method `conf.echo=` (set to `true` or `false`).
#
# As stated above, by default IRB prints the values returned by all input
# commands; but IRB offers special treatment for values returned by assignment
# statements, which may be:
#
# *   Printed with truncation (to fit on a single line of output), which is the
#     default; an ellipsis (`...` is suffixed, to indicate the truncation):
#
#         irb(main):001> x = 'abc' * 100
#
#
# > "abcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabc...
#
# *   Printed in full (regardless of the length).
# *   Suppressed (not printed at all)
#
#
# You can change the initial behavior by:
#
# *   Adding to the configuration file: `IRB.conf[:ECHO_ON_ASSIGNMENT] = false`.
#     (The default value for this entry is `niL`, which means the same as
#     `:truncate`.)
# *   Giving command-line option `--noecho-on-assignment` or
#     `--echo-on-assignment`. (The default is `--truncate-echo-on-assignment`.)
#
#
# During the session, you can change the current setting with configuration
# method `conf.echo_on_assignment=` (set to `true`, `false`, or `:truncate`).
#
# By default, IRB formats returned values by calling method `inspect`.
#
# You can change the initial behavior by:
#
# *   Adding to the configuration file: `IRB.conf[:INSPECT_MODE] = false`. (The
#     default value for this entry is `true`.)
# *   Giving command-line option `--noinspect`. (The default is `--inspect`.)
#
#
# During the session, you can change the setting using method
# `conf.inspect_mode=`.
#
# ### Multiline Output
#
# By default, IRB prefixes a newline to a multiline response.
#
# You can change the initial default value by adding to the configuration file:
#
#     IRB.conf[:NEWLINE_BEFORE_MULTILINE_OUTPUT] = false
#
# During a session, you can retrieve or set the value using methods
# `conf.newline_before_multiline_output?` and
# `conf.newline_before_multiline_output=`.
#
# Examples:
#
#     irb(main):001> conf.inspect_mode = false
#     => false
#     irb(main):002> "foo\nbar"
#     =>
#     foo
#     bar
#     irb(main):003> conf.newline_before_multiline_output = false
#     => false
#     irb(main):004> "foo\nbar"
#     => foo
#     bar
#
# ### Evaluation History
#
# By default, IRB saves no history of evaluations (returned values), and the
# related methods `conf.eval_history`, `_`, and `__` are undefined.
#
# You can turn on that history, and set the maximum number of evaluations to be
# stored:
#
# *   In the configuration file: add `IRB.conf[:EVAL_HISTORY] = *n*`. (Examples
#     below assume that we've added `IRB.conf[:EVAL_HISTORY] = 5`.)
# *   In the session (at any time): `conf.eval_history = *n*`.
#
#
# If `n` is zero, all evaluation history is stored.
#
# Doing either of the above:
#
# *   Sets the maximum size of the evaluation history; defines method
#     `conf.eval_history`, which returns the maximum size `n` of the evaluation
#     history:
#
#         irb(main):001> conf.eval_history = 5
#         => 5
#         irb(main):002> conf.eval_history
#         => 5
#
# *   Defines variable `_`, which contains the most recent evaluation, or `nil`
#     if none; same as method `conf.last_value`:
#
#         irb(main):003> _
#         => 5
#         irb(main):004> :foo
#         => :foo
#         irb(main):005> :bar
#         => :bar
#         irb(main):006> _
#         => :bar
#         irb(main):007> _
#         => :bar
#
# *   Defines variable `__`:
#
#     *   `__` unadorned: contains all evaluation history:
#
#             irb(main):008> :foo
#             => :foo
#             irb(main):009> :bar
#             => :bar
#             irb(main):010> :baz
#             => :baz
#             irb(main):011> :bat
#             => :bat
#             irb(main):012> :bam
#             => :bam
#             irb(main):013> __
#             =>
#             9 :bar
#             10 :baz
#             11 :bat
#             12 :bam
#             irb(main):014> __
#             =>
#             10 :baz
#             11 :bat
#             12 :bam
#             13 ...self-history...
#
#         Note that when the evaluation is multiline, it is displayed
#         differently.
#
#     *   `__[`*m*`]`:
#
#         *   Positive *m*:  contains the evaluation for the given line number,
#             or `nil` if that line number is not in the evaluation history:
#
#                 irb(main):015> __[12]
#                 => :bam
#                 irb(main):016> __[1]
#                 => nil
#
#         *   Negative *m*: contains the `mth`-from-end evaluation, or `nil` if
#             that evaluation is not in the evaluation history:
#
#                 irb(main):017> __[-3]
#                 => :bam
#                 irb(main):018> __[-13]
#                 => nil
#
#         *   Zero *m*: contains `nil`:
#
#                 irb(main):019> __[0]
#                 => nil
#
#
#
#
# ### Prompt and Return Formats
#
# By default, IRB uses the prompt and return value formats defined in its
# `:DEFAULT` prompt mode.
#
# #### The Default Prompt and Return Format
#
# The default prompt and return values look like this:
#
#     irb(main):001> 1 + 1
#     => 2
#     irb(main):002> 2 + 2
#     => 4
#
# The prompt includes:
#
# *   The name of the running program (`irb`); see [IRB
#     Name](rdoc-ref:IRB@IRB+Name).
# *   The name of the current session (`main`); See [IRB
#     Sessions](rdoc-ref:IRB@IRB+Sessions).
# *   A 3-digit line number (1-based).
#
#
# The default prompt actually defines three formats:
#
# *   One for most situations (as above):
#
#         irb(main):003> Dir
#         => Dir
#
# *   One for when the typed command is a statement continuation (adds trailing
#     asterisk):
#
#         irb(main):004* Dir.
#
# *   One for when the typed command is a string continuation (adds trailing
#     single-quote):
#
#         irb(main):005' Dir.entries('.
#
#
# You can see the prompt change as you type the characters in the following:
#
#     irb(main):001* Dir.entries('.').select do |entry|
#     irb(main):002*   entry.start_with?('R')
#     irb(main):003> end
#     => ["README.md", "Rakefile"]
#
# #### Pre-Defined Prompts
#
# IRB has several pre-defined prompts, stored in hash `IRB.conf[:PROMPT]`:
#
#     irb(main):001> IRB.conf[:PROMPT].keys
#     => [:NULL, :DEFAULT, :CLASSIC, :SIMPLE, :INF_RUBY, :XMP]
#
# To see the full data for these, type `IRB.conf[:PROMPT]`.
#
# Most of these prompt definitions include specifiers that represent values like
# the IRB name, session name, and line number; see [Prompt
# Specifiers](rdoc-ref:IRB@Prompt+Specifiers).
#
# You can change the initial prompt and return format by:
#
# *   Adding to the configuration file: `IRB.conf[:PROMPT] = *mode*` where
#     *mode* is the symbol name of a prompt mode.
# *   Giving a command-line option:
#
#     *   `--prompt *mode*`: sets the prompt mode to *mode*. where *mode* is the
#         symbol name of a prompt mode.
#     *   `--simple-prompt` or `--sample-book-mode`: sets the prompt mode to
#         `:SIMPLE`.
#     *   `--inf-ruby-mode`: sets the prompt mode to `:INF_RUBY` and suppresses
#         both `--multiline` and `--singleline`.
#     *   `--noprompt`: suppresses prompting; does not affect echoing.
#
#
#
# You can retrieve or set the current prompt mode with methods
#
# `conf.prompt_mode` and `conf.prompt_mode=`.
#
# If you're interested in prompts and return formats other than the defaults,
# you might experiment by trying some of the others.
#
# #### Custom Prompts
#
# You can also define custom prompts and return formats, which may be done
# either in an IRB session or in the configuration file.
#
# A prompt in IRB actually defines three prompts, as seen above. For simple
# custom data, we'll make all three the same:
#
#     irb(main):001* IRB.conf[:PROMPT][:MY_PROMPT] = {
#     irb(main):002*   PROMPT_I: ': ',
#     irb(main):003*   PROMPT_C: ': ',
#     irb(main):004*   PROMPT_S: ': ',
#     irb(main):005*   RETURN: '=> '
#     irb(main):006> }
#     => {:PROMPT_I=>": ", :PROMPT_C=>": ", :PROMPT_S=>": ", :RETURN=>"=> "}
#
# If you define the custom prompt in the configuration file, you can also make
# it the current prompt by adding:
#
#     IRB.conf[:PROMPT_MODE] = :MY_PROMPT
#
# Regardless of where it's defined, you can make it the current prompt in a
# session:
#
#     conf.prompt_mode = :MY_PROMPT
#
# You can view or modify the current prompt data with various configuration
# methods:
#
# *   `conf.prompt_mode`, `conf.prompt_mode=`.
# *   `conf.prompt_c`, `conf.c=`.
# *   `conf.prompt_i`, `conf.i=`.
# *   `conf.prompt_s`, `conf.s=`.
# *   `conf.return_format`, `return_format=`.
#
#
# #### Prompt Specifiers
#
# A prompt's definition can include specifiers for which certain values are
# substituted:
#
# *   `%N`: the name of the running program.
# *   `%m`: the value of `self.to_s`.
# *   `%M`: the value of `self.inspect`.
# *   `%l`: an indication of the type of string; one of `"`, `'`, `/`, `]`.
# *   `%NNi`: Indentation level. NN is a 2-digit number that specifies the number
#             of digits of the indentation level (03 will result in 001).
# *   `%NNn`: Line number. NN is a 2-digit number that specifies the number
#             of digits of the line number (03 will result in 001).
# *   `%%`: Literal `%`.
#
#
# ### Verbosity
#
# By default, IRB verbosity is disabled, which means that output is smaller
# rather than larger.
#
# You can enable verbosity by:
#
# *   Adding to the configuration file: `IRB.conf[:VERBOSE] = true` (the default
#     is `nil`).
# *   Giving command-line options `--verbose` (the default is `--noverbose`).
#
#
# During a session, you can retrieve or set verbosity with methods
# `conf.verbose` and `conf.verbose=`.
#
# ### Help
#
# Command-line option `--version` causes IRB to print its help text and exit.
#
# ### Version
#
# Command-line option `--version` causes IRB to print its version text and exit.
#
# ## Input and Output
#
# ### Color Highlighting
#
# By default, IRB color highlighting is enabled, and is used for both:
#
# *   Input: As you type, IRB reads the typed characters and highlights elements
#     that it recognizes; it also highlights errors such as mismatched
#     parentheses.
# *   Output: IRB highlights syntactical elements.
#
#
# You can disable color highlighting by:
#
# *   Adding to the configuration file: `IRB.conf[:USE_COLORIZE] = false` (the
#     default value is `true`).
# *   Giving command-line option `--nocolorize`
#
#
# ## Debugging
#
# Command-line option `-d` sets variables `$VERBOSE` and `$DEBUG` to `true`;
# these have no effect on IRB output.
#
# ### Warnings
#
# Command-line option `-w` suppresses warnings.
#
# Command-line option `-W[*level*]` sets warning level;
#
# * 0=silence
# * 1=medium
# * 2=verbose
#
# ## Other Features
#
# ### Load Modules
#
# You can specify the names of modules that are to be required at startup.
#
# Array `conf.load_modules` determines the modules (if any) that are to be
# required during session startup. The array is used only during session
# startup, so the initial value is the only one that counts.
#
# The default initial value is `[]` (load no modules):
#
#     irb(main):001> conf.load_modules
#     => []
#
# You can set the default initial value via:
#
# *   Command-line option `-r`
#
#          $ irb -r csv -r json
#         irb(main):001> conf.load_modules
#         => ["csv", "json"]
#
# *   Hash entry `IRB.conf[:LOAD_MODULES] = *array*`:
#
#         IRB.conf[:LOAD_MODULES] = %w[csv, json]
#
#
# Note that the configuration file entry overrides the command-line options.
#
# ### RI Documentation Directories
#
# You can specify the paths to RI documentation directories that are to be
# loaded (in addition to the default directories) at startup; see details about
# RI by typing `ri --help`.
#
# Array `conf.extra_doc_dirs` determines the directories (if any) that are to be
# loaded during session startup. The array is used only during session startup,
# so the initial value is the only one that counts.
#
# The default initial value is `[]` (load no extra documentation):
#
#     irb(main):001> conf.extra_doc_dirs
#     => []
#
# You can set the default initial value via:
#
# *   Command-line option `--extra_doc_dir`
#
#         $ irb --extra-doc-dir your_doc_dir --extra-doc-dir my_doc_dir
#         irb(main):001> conf.extra_doc_dirs
#         => ["your_doc_dir", "my_doc_dir"]
#
# *   Hash entry `IRB.conf[:EXTRA_DOC_DIRS] = *array*`:
#
#         IRB.conf[:EXTRA_DOC_DIRS] = %w[your_doc_dir my_doc_dir]
#
#
# Note that the configuration file entry overrides the command-line options.
#
# ### IRB Name
#
# You can specify a name for IRB.
#
# The default initial value is `'irb'`:
#
#     irb(main):001> conf.irb_name
#     => "irb"
#
# You can set the default initial value via hash entry `IRB.conf[:IRB_NAME] =
# *string*`:
#
#     IRB.conf[:IRB_NAME] = 'foo'
#
# ### Application Name
#
# You can specify an application name for the IRB session.
#
# The default initial value is `'irb'`:
#
#     irb(main):001> conf.ap_name
#     => "irb"
#
# You can set the default initial value via hash entry `IRB.conf[:AP_NAME] =
# *string*`:
#
#     IRB.conf[:AP_NAME] = 'my_ap_name'
#
# ### Configuration Monitor
#
# You can monitor changes to the configuration by assigning a proc to
# `IRB.conf[:IRB_RC]` in the configuration file:
#
#     IRB.conf[:IRB_RC] = proc {|conf| puts conf.class }
#
# Each time the configuration is changed, that proc is called with argument
# `conf`:
#
# ### Encodings
#
# Command-line option `-E *ex*[:*in*]` sets initial external (ex) and internal
# (in) encodings.
#
# Command-line option `-U` sets both to UTF-8.
#
# ### Commands
#
# Please use the `help` command to see the list of available commands.
#
# ### IRB Sessions
#
# IRB has a special feature, that allows you to manage many sessions at once.
#
# You can create new sessions with Irb.irb, and get a list of current sessions
# with the `jobs` command in the prompt.
#
# #### Configuration
#
# The command line options, or IRB.conf, specify the default behavior of
# Irb.irb.
#
# On the other hand, each conf in IRB@Command-Line+Options is used to
# individually configure IRB.irb.
#
# If a proc is set for `IRB.conf[:IRB_RC]`, its will be invoked after execution
# of that proc with the context of the current session as its argument. Each
# session can be configured using this mechanism.
#
# #### Session variables
#
# There are a few variables in every Irb session that can come in handy:
#
# `_`
# :   The value command executed, as a local variable
# `__`
# :   The history of evaluated commands. Available only if
#     `IRB.conf[:EVAL_HISTORY]` is not `nil` (which is the default). See also
#     IRB::Context#eval_history= and IRB::History.
# `__[line_no]`
# :   Returns the evaluation value at the given line number, `line_no`. If
#     `line_no` is a negative, the return value `line_no` many lines before the
#     most recent return value.
#
#
# ## Restrictions
#
# Ruby code typed into IRB behaves the same as Ruby code in a file, except that:
#
# *   Because IRB evaluates input immediately after it is syntactically
#     complete, some results may be slightly different.
# *   Forking may not be well behaved.
