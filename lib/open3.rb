# Open3 gives you access to stdin, stdout, and stderr when running other
# programs.
#

#
# Open3 grants you access to stdin, stdout, stderr and a thread to wait for the
# child process when running another program.
# You can specify various attributes, redirections, current directory, etc., of
# the program in the same way as for Process.spawn.

require 'open3/version'

# \Module \Open3 supports creating child processes
# with access to their $stdin, $stdout, and $stderr streams.
#
# == What's Here
#
# Each of these methods executes a given command in a new process or subshell,
# or multiple commands in new processes and/or subshells:
#
# - Each of these methods executes a single command in a process or subshell,
#   accepts a string for input to $stdin,
#   and returns string output from $stdout, $stderr, or both:
#
#   - Open3.capture2: Executes the command;
#     returns the string from $stdout.
#   - Open3.capture2e: Executes the command;
#     returns the string from merged $stdout and $stderr.
#   - Open3.capture3: Executes the command;
#     returns strings from $stdout and $stderr.
#
# - Each of these methods executes a single command in a process or subshell,
#   and returns pipes for $stdin, $stdout, and/or $stderr:
#
#   - Open3.popen2: Executes the command;
#     returns pipes for $stdin and $stdout.
#   - Open3.popen2e: Executes the command;
#     returns pipes for $stdin and merged $stdout and $stderr.
#   - Open3.popen3: Executes the command;
#     returns pipes for $stdin, $stdout, and $stderr.
#
# - Each of these methods executes one or more commands in processes and/or subshells,
#   returns pipes for the first $stdin, the last $stdout, or both:
#
#   - Open3.pipeline_r: Returns a pipe for the last $stdout.
#   - Open3.pipeline_rw: Returns pipes for the first $stdin and the last $stdout.
#   - Open3.pipeline_w: Returns a pipe for the first $stdin.
#   - Open3.pipeline_start: Does not wait for processes to complete.
#   - Open3.pipeline: Waits for processes to complete.
#
# Each of the methods above accepts:
#
# - An optional hash of environment variable names and values;
#   see {Execution Environment}[rdoc-ref:Process@Execution+Environment].
# - A required string argument that is a +command_line+ or +exe_path+;
#   see {Argument command_line or exe_path}[rdoc-ref:Process@Argument+command_line+or+exe_path].
# - An optional hash of execution options;
#   see {Execution Options}[rdoc-ref:Process@Execution+Options].
#
# Note: When using methods that set up pipes for I/O streams,
# the corresponding redirection options in the execution options
# will be ignored for those streams.

module Open3

  # :call-seq:
  #   Open3.popen3([env, ] command_line, options = {}) -> [stdin, stdout, stderr, wait_thread]

  #   Open3.popen3([env, ] exe_path, *args, options = {}) {|stdin, stdout, stderr, wait_thread| ... } -> object
  #
  # Basically a wrapper for
  # {Process.spawn}[rdoc-ref:Process.spawn]
  # that:
  #
  # - Creates a child process, by calling Process.spawn with the given arguments.
  # - Creates streams +stdin+, +stdout+, and +stderr+,
  #   which are the standard input, standard output, and standard error streams
  #   in the child process.
  # - Creates thread +wait_thread+ that waits for the child process to exit;
  #   the thread has method +pid+, which returns the process ID
  #   of the child process.
  #
  # With no block given, returns the array
  # <tt>[stdin, stdout, stderr, wait_thread]</tt>.
  # The caller should close each of the three returned streams.
  #
  #   stdin, stdout, stderr, wait_thread = Open3.popen3('echo')
  #   # => [#<IO:fd 8>, #<IO:fd 10>, #<IO:fd 12>, #<Process::Waiter:0x00007f58d5428f58 run>]
  #   stdin.close
  #   stdout.close
  #   stderr.close
  #   wait_thread.pid   # => 2210481
  #   wait_thread.value # => #<Process::Status: pid 2210481 exit 0>
  #
  # With a block given, calls the block with the four variables
  # (three streams and the wait thread)
  # and returns the block's return value.
  # The caller need not close the streams:
  #
  #   Open3.popen3('echo') do |stdin, stdout, stderr, wait_thread|
  #     p stdin
  #     p stdout
  #     p stderr
  #     p wait_thread
  #     p wait_thread.pid
  #     p wait_thread.value
  #   end
  #
  # Output:
  #
  #   #<IO:fd 6>
  #   #<IO:fd 7>
  #   #<IO:fd 9>
  #   #<Process::Waiter:0x00007f58d53606e8 sleep>
  #   2211047
  #   #<Process::Status: pid 2211047 exit 0>
  #
  # Like Process.spawn, this method has potential security vulnerabilities
  # if called with untrusted input;
  # see {Command Injection}[rdoc-ref:command_injection.rdoc@Command+Injection].
  #
  # Blocking behavior:
  # - With a block: waits for the child process to exit before returning.
  # - Without a block: returns immediately without waiting for the child process;
  #   the caller must call +wait_thread.join+ to wait for the process to exit.
  #
  # If the first argument is a hash, it becomes leading argument +env+
  # in the call to Process.spawn;
  # see {Execution Environment}[rdoc-ref:Process@Execution+Environment].
  #
  # If the last argument is a hash, it becomes trailing argument +options+
  # in the call to Process.spawn;
  # see {Execution Options}[rdoc-ref:Process@Execution+Options].
  #
  # Note: The redirection options :in, :out, and :err will be ignored
  # because popen3 sets up pipes for stdin, stdout, and stderr.
  #
  # The single required argument is one of the following:
  #
  # - +command_line+ if it is a string,
  #   and if it begins with a shell reserved word or special built-in,
  #   or if it contains one or more metacharacters.
  # - +exe_path+ otherwise.
  #
  # <b>Argument +command_line+</b>
  #
  # \String argument +command_line+ is a command line to be passed to a shell;
  # it must begin with a shell reserved word, begin with a special built-in,
  # or contain meta characters:
  #
  #   Open3.popen3('if true; then echo "Foo"; fi') {|*args| p args } # Shell reserved word.
  #   Open3.popen3('echo') {|*args| p args }                         # Built-in.
  #   Open3.popen3('date > date.tmp') {|*args| p args }              # Contains meta character.
  #
  # Output (similar for each call above):
  #
  #   [#<IO:(closed)>, #<IO:(closed)>, #<IO:(closed)>, #<Process::Waiter:0x00007f58d52f28c8 dead>]
  #
  # The command line may also contain arguments and options for the command:
  #
  #   Open3.popen3('echo "Foo"') { |i, o, e, t| o.gets }
  #   "Foo\n"
  #
  # <b>Argument +exe_path+</b>
  #
  # Argument +exe_path+ is one of the following:
  #
  # - The string path to an executable to be called.
  # - A 2-element array containing the path to an executable
  #   and the string to be used as the name of the executing process.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   Open3.popen3('/usr/bin/date') { |i, o, e, t| o.gets }
  #   # => "Wed Sep 27 02:56:44 PM CDT 2023\n"
  #
  # Ruby invokes the executable directly, with no shell and no shell expansion:
  #
  #   Open3.popen3('doesnt_exist') { |i, o, e, t| o.gets } # Raises Errno::ENOENT
  #
  # If one or more +args+ is given, each is an argument or option
  # to be passed to the executable:
  #
  #   Open3.popen3('echo', 'C #') { |i, o, e, t| o.gets }
  #   # => "C #\n"
  #   Open3.popen3('echo', 'hello', 'world') { |i, o, e, t| o.gets }
  #   # => "hello world\n"
  #
  # Take care to avoid deadlocks.
  # Output streams +stdout+ and +stderr+ have fixed-size buffers,
  # so reading extensively from one but not the other can cause a deadlock
  # when the unread buffer fills.
  # To avoid that, +stdout+ and +stderr+ should be read simultaneously
  # (using threads or IO.select).

  # Basically a wrapper for Open3.popen3 that:
  #
  # - Creates a child process, by calling Open3.popen3 with the given arguments
  #   (except for certain entries in hash +options+; see below).
  # - Returns as strings +stdout_s+ and +stderr_s+ the standard output
  #   and standard error of the child process.
  # - Returns as +status+ a <tt>Process::Status</tt> object
  #   that represents the exit status of the child process.
  #
  # Returns the array <tt>[stdout_s, stderr_s, status]</tt>:

  # Like Process.spawn, this method has potential security vulnerabilities
  # if called with untrusted input;
  # see {Command Injection}[rdoc-ref:command_injection.rdoc@Command+Injection].
  #
  # Unlike Process.spawn, this method waits for the child process to exit
  # before returning, so the caller need not do so.
  #
  # If the first argument is a hash, it becomes leading argument +env+
  # in the call to Open3.popen3;

  #
  # The single required argument is one of the following:

  #   and if it begins with a shell reserved word or special built-in,
  #   or if it contains one or more metacharacters.
  # - +exe_path+ otherwise.
  #
  # <b>Argument +command_line+</b>
  #
  # \String argument +command_line+ is a command line to be passed to a shell;

  # {Process.spawn}[rdoc-ref:Process.spawn]
  # that:
  #
  # - Creates a child process for each of the given +cmds+
  #   by calling Process.spawn.
  # - Pipes the +stdout+ from each child to the +stdin+ of the next child,
  #   or, for the first child, pipes the caller's +stdout+ to the child's +stdin+.
  #
  # The method does not wait for child processes to exit,
  # so the caller must do so.
  #
  # With no block given, returns a 2-element array containing:
  #
  # - The +stdin+ stream of the first child process.
  # - An array of the wait threads for all of the child processes.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   first_stdin, wait_threads = Open3.pipeline_w('sort', 'cat -n')
  #   # => [#<IO:fd 7>, [#<Process::Waiter:0x000055e8de928278 run>, #<Process::Waiter:0x000055e8de923e80 run>]]
  #   first_stdin.puts("foo\nbar\nbaz")
  #   first_stdin.close # Send EOF to sort.
  #   wait_threads.each do |wait_thread|
  #     wait_thread.join
  #   end
  #
  # Output:
  #
  #   1	bar
  #   2	baz
  #   3	foo
  #
  # With a block given, calls the block with the +stdin+ stream
  # of the first child process,
  # and an array of the wait processes.
  # The method automatically waits for all processes to exit after the block returns.
  #
  #   Open3.pipeline_w('sort', 'cat -n') do |first_stdin, wait_threads|
  #     first_stdin.puts("foo\nbar\nbaz")
  #     first_stdin.close # Send EOF to sort.
  #     # No need to join wait_threads - the method handles it automatically
