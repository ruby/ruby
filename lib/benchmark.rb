#
# == Overview
#
# The Benchmark module provides methods for benchmarking Ruby code, giving
# detailed reports on the time taken for each task.
#

# The Benchmark module provides methods to measure and report the time
# used to execute Ruby code.
#
# * Measure the time to construct the string given by the expression
#   <code>"a"*1_000_000_000</code>:
#
#       require 'benchmark'
#
#       puts Benchmark.measure { "a"*1_000_000_000 }
#
#   On my machine (OSX 10.8.3 on i5 1.7 Ghz) this generates:
#
#       0.350000   0.400000   0.750000 (  0.835234)
#
#   This report shows the user CPU time, system CPU time, the sum of
#   the user and system CPU times, and the elapsed real time. The unit
#   of time is seconds.
#
# * Do some experiments sequentially using the #bm method:
#
#       require 'benchmark'
#
#       n = 5000000
#       Benchmark.bm do |x|
#         x.report { for i in 1..n; a = "1"; end }
#         x.report { n.times do   ; a = "1"; end }
#         x.report { 1.upto(n) do ; a = "1"; end }
#       end
#
#   The result:
#
#              user     system      total        real
#          1.010000   0.000000   1.010000 (  1.014479)
#          1.000000   0.000000   1.000000 (  0.998261)
#          0.980000   0.000000   0.980000 (  0.981335)
#
# * Continuing the previous example, put a label in each report:
#
#       require 'benchmark'
#
#       n = 5000000
#       Benchmark.bm(7) do |x|
#         x.report("for:")   { for i in 1..n; a = "1"; end }
#         x.report("times:") { n.times do   ; a = "1"; end }
#         x.report("upto:")  { 1.upto(n) do ; a = "1"; end }
#       end
#
# The result:
#
#                     user     system      total        real
#       for:      1.010000   0.000000   1.010000 (  1.015688)
#       times:    1.000000   0.000000   1.000000 (  1.003611)
#       upto:     1.030000   0.000000   1.030000 (  1.028098)
#
# * The times for some benchmarks depend on the order in which items
#   are run.  These differences are due to the cost of memory
#   allocation and garbage collection. To avoid these discrepancies,
#   the #bmbm method is provided.  For example, to compare ways to
#   sort an array of floats:
#
#       require 'benchmark'
#
#       array = (1..1000000).map { rand }
#
#       Benchmark.bmbm do |x|
#         x.report("sort!") { array.dup.sort! }
#         x.report("sort")  { array.dup.sort  }
#       end
#
#   The result:
#
#        Rehearsal -----------------------------------------
#        sort!   1.490000   0.010000   1.500000 (  1.490520)
#        sort    1.460000   0.000000   1.460000 (  1.463025)
#        -------------------------------- total: 2.960000sec
#
#                    user     system      total        real
#        sort!   1.460000   0.000000   1.460000 (  1.460465)
#        sort    1.450000   0.010000   1.460000 (  1.448327)
#
# * Report statistics of sequential experiments with unique labels,
#   using the #benchmark method:
#
#       require 'benchmark'
#       include Benchmark         # we need the CAPTION and FORMAT constants
#
#       n = 5000000
#       Benchmark.benchmark(CAPTION, 7, FORMAT, ">total:", ">avg:") do |x|
#         tf = x.report("for:")   { for i in 1..n; a = "1"; end }
#         tt = x.report("times:") { n.times do   ; a = "1"; end }
#         tu = x.report("upto:")  { 1.upto(n) do ; a = "1"; end }
#         [tf+tt+tu, (tf+tt+tu)/3]
#       end
#
#   The result:
#
#                     user     system      total        real
#        for:      0.950000   0.000000   0.950000 (  0.952039)
#        times:    0.980000   0.000000   0.980000 (  0.984938)
#        upto:     0.950000   0.000000   0.950000 (  0.946787)
#        >total:   2.880000   0.000000   2.880000 (  2.883764)

module Benchmark

  BENCHMARK_VERSION = "2002-04-25" # :nodoc:

  # Invokes the block with a Benchmark::Report object, which
  # may be used to collect and report on the results of individual
  # benchmark tests. Reserves +label_width+ leading spaces for
  # labels on each line. Prints +caption+ at the top of the
  # report, and uses +format+ to format each line.
  # Returns an array of Benchmark::Tms objects.
  #
  # If the block returns an array of
  # Benchmark::Tms objects, these will be used to format
  # additional lines of output. If +label+ parameters are
  # given, these are used to label these extra lines.
  #
  # _Note_: Other methods provide a simpler interface to this one, and are
  # suitable for nearly all benchmarking requirements.  See the examples in
  # Benchmark, and the #bm and #bmbm methods.
  #
  # Example:

  #     require 'benchmark'

  #     Benchmark.benchmark(CAPTION, 7, FORMAT, ">total:", ">avg:") do |x|
  #       tf = x.report("for:")   { for i in 1..n; a = "1"; end }
  #       tt = x.report("times:") { n.times do   ; a = "1"; end }
  #       tu = x.report("upto:")  { 1.upto(n) do ; a = "1"; end }

  # Sometimes benchmark results are skewed because code executed
  # earlier encounters different garbage collection overheads than
  # that run later. #bmbm attempts to minimize this effect by running
  # the tests twice, the first time as a rehearsal in order to get the
  # runtime environment stable, the second time for
  # real. GC.start is executed before the start of each of
  # the real timings; the cost of this is not included in the
  # timings. In reality, though, there's only so much that #bmbm can
  # do, and the results are not guaranteed to be isolated from garbage
  # collection and other effects.
  #
  # Because #bmbm takes two passes through the tests, it can
  # calculate the required label width.
