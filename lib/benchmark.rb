# == Overview
#
# The Benchmark module provides methods for benchmarking Ruby code, giving
# detailed reports on the time taken for each task.
#

# The Benchmark module provides methods to measure and report the time
# used to execute Ruby code.
#
# * Measure the time to construct the string given by the expression
#   <tt>"a"*1_000_000</tt>:
#
#       require 'benchmark'
#
#       puts Benchmark.measure { "a"*1_000_000 }
#
#   On my machine (FreeBSD 3.2 on P5, 100MHz) this generates:
#
#       1.166667   0.050000   1.216667 (  0.571355)
#
#   This report shows the user CPU time, system CPU time, the sum of
#   the user and system CPU times, and the elapsed real time. The unit
#   of time is seconds.
#
# * Do some experiments sequentially using the #bm method:
#
#       require 'benchmark'
#
#       n = 50000
#       Benchmark.bm do |x|
#         x.report { for i in 1..n; a = "1"; end }
#         x.report { n.times do   ; a = "1"; end }
#         x.report { 1.upto(n) do ; a = "1"; end }
#       end
#
#   The result:
#
#              user     system      total        real
#          1.033333   0.016667   1.016667 (  0.492106)
#          1.483333   0.000000   1.483333 (  0.694605)
#          1.516667   0.000000   1.516667 (  0.711077)
#
# * Continuing the previous example, put a label in each report:
#
#       require 'benchmark'
#
#       n = 50000
#       Benchmark.bm(7) do |x|
#         x.report("for:")   { for i in 1..n; a = "1"; end }
#         x.report("times:") { n.times do   ; a = "1"; end }
#         x.report("upto:")  { 1.upto(n) do ; a = "1"; end }
#       end
#
# The result:
#
#                     user     system      total        real
#        for:     1.050000   0.000000   1.050000 (  0.503462)
#        times:   1.533333   0.016667   1.550000 (  0.735473)
#        upto:    1.500000   0.016667   1.516667 (  0.711239)
#
#
# * The times for some benchmarks depend on the order in which items
#   are run.  These differences are due to the cost of memory
#   allocation and garbage collection. To avoid these discrepancies,
#   the #bmbm method is provided.  For example, to compare ways to
#   sort an array of floats:
#
#       require 'benchmark'
#
#       array = (1..1000000).map { rand }
#
#       Benchmark.bmbm do |x|
#         x.report("sort!") { array.dup.sort! }
#         x.report("sort")  { array.dup.sort  }
#       end
#
#   The result:
#
#        Rehearsal -----------------------------------------
#        sort!  11.928000   0.010000  11.938000 ( 12.756000)
#        sort   13.048000   0.020000  13.068000 ( 13.857000)
#        ------------------------------- total: 25.006000sec
#
#                    user     system      total        real
#        sort!  12.959000   0.010000  12.969000 ( 13.793000)
#        sort   12.007000   0.000000  12.007000 ( 12.791000)
#
#
# * Report statistics of sequential experiments with unique labels,
#   using the #benchmark method:
#
#       require 'benchmark'
#       include Benchmark         # we need the CAPTION and FORMAT constants
#
#       n = 50000
#       Benchmark.benchmark(CAPTION, 7, FORMAT, ">total:", ">avg:") do |x|
#         tf = x.report("for:")   { for i in 1..n; a = "1"; end }
#         tt = x.report("times:") { n.times do   ; a = "1"; end }
#         tu = x.report("upto:")  { 1.upto(n) do ; a = "1"; end }
#         [tf+tt+tu, (tf+tt+tu)/3]
#       end
#
#   The result:
#
#                     user     system      total        real
#        for:     1.016667   0.016667   1.033333 (  0.485749)
#        times:   1.450000   0.016667   1.466667 (  0.681367)
#        upto:    1.533333   0.000000   1.533333 (  0.722166)
#        >total:  4.000000   0.033333   4.033333 (  1.889282)

module Benchmark

  BENCHMARK_VERSION = "2002-04-25" #:nodoc"

  # Invokes the block with a <tt>Benchmark::Report</tt> object, which
  # may be used to collect and report on the results of individual
  # benchmark tests. Reserves <i>label_width</i> leading spaces for
  # labels on each line. Prints _caption_ at the top of the
  # report, and uses _format_ to format each line.
  # Returns an array of Benchmark::Tms objects.
  #
  # If the block returns an array of
  # <tt>Benchmark::Tms</tt> objects, these will be used to format
  # additional lines of output. If _label_ parameters are
  # given, these are used to label these extra lines.
  #
  # _Note_: Other methods provide a simpler interface to this one, and are
  # suitable for nearly all benchmarking requirements.  See the examples in
  # Benchmark, and the #bm and #bmbm methods.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #     require 'benchmark'
  #     include Benchmark          # we need the CAPTION and FORMAT constants
  #
  #     n = 50000
  #     Benchmark.benchmark(CAPTION, 7, FORMAT, ">total:", ">avg:") do |x|
  #       tf = x.report("for:")   { for i in 1..n; a = "1"; end }
  #       tt = x.report("times:") { n.times do   ; a = "1"; end }
  #       tu = x.report("upto:")  { 1.upto(n) do ; a = "1"; end }
