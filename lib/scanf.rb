#
# == Description
#
# scanf is an implementation of the C function scanf(3), modified as necessary
# for Ruby compatibility.
#
# the methods provided are String#scanf, IO#scanf, and
# Kernel#scanf. Kernel#scanf is a wrapper around STDIN.scanf.  IO#scanf
# can be used on any IO stream, including file handles and sockets.
# scanf can be called either with or without a block.
#
# Scanf scans an input string or stream according to a <b>format</b>, as
# described below in Conversions, and returns an array of matches between
# the format and the input.  The format is defined in a string, and is
# similar (though not identical) to the formats used in Kernel#printf and
# Kernel#sprintf.
#
# The format may contain <b>conversion specifiers</b>, which tell scanf
# what form (type) each particular matched substring should be converted
# to (e.g., decimal integer, floating point number, literal string,
# etc.)  The matches and conversions take place from left to right, and
# the conversions themselves are returned as an array.
#
# The format string may also contain characters other than those in the
# conversion specifiers.  White space (blanks, tabs, or newlines) in the
# format string matches any amount of white space, including none, in
# the input.  Everything else matches only itself.
#
# Scanning stops, and scanf returns, when any input character fails to
# match the specifications in the format string, or when input is
# exhausted, or when everything in the format string has been
# matched. All matches found up to the stopping point are returned in
# the return array (or yielded to the block, if a block was given).
#
#
# == Basic usage
#
#   require 'scanf'
#
#   # String#scanf and IO#scanf take a single argument, the format string
#   array = a_string.scanf("%d%s")
#   array = an_io.scanf("%d%s")
#
#   # Kernel#scanf reads from STDIN
#   array = scanf("%d%s")
#
# == Block usage
#
# When called with a block, scanf keeps scanning the input, cycling back
# to the beginning of the format string, and yields a new array of
# conversions to the block every time the format string is matched
# (including partial matches, but not including complete failures).  The
# actual return value of scanf when called with a block is an array
# containing the results of all the executions of the block.
#
#   str = "123 abc 456 def 789 ghi"
#   str.scanf("%d%s") { |num,str| [ num * 2, str.upcase ] }
#   # => [[246, "ABC"], [912, "DEF"], [1578, "GHI"]]
#
# == Conversions
#
# The single argument to scanf is a format string, which generally
# includes one or more conversion specifiers.  Conversion specifiers
# begin with the percent character ('%') and include information about
# what scanf should next scan for (string, decimal number, single
# character, etc.).
#
# There may be an optional maximum field width, expressed as a decimal
# integer, between the % and the conversion.  If no width is given, a
# default of `infinity' is used (with the exception of the %c specifier;
# see below).  Otherwise, given a field width of <em>n</em> for a given
# conversion, at most <em>n</em> characters are scanned in processing
# that conversion.  Before conversion begins, most conversions skip
# white space in the input string; this white space is not counted
# against the field width.
#
# The following conversions are available.
#
# [%]
#   Matches a literal `%'. That is, `%%' in the format string matches a
#   single input `%' character. No conversion is done, and the resulting
#   '%' is not included in the return array.
#
# [d]
#   Matches an optionally signed decimal integer.
#
# [u]
#   Same as d.
#
# [i]
#   Matches an optionally signed integer. The integer is read in base
#   16 if it begins with `0x' or `0X', in base 8 if it begins with `0',
#   and in base 10 other- wise. Only characters that correspond to the
#   base are recognized.
#
# [o]
#   Matches an optionally signed octal integer.
#
# [x, X]
#   Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer,
#
# [a, e, f, g, A, E, F, G]
#   Matches an optionally signed floating-point number.
#
# [s]
#   Matches a sequence of non-white-space character. The input string stops at
#   white space or at the maximum field width, whichever occurs first.
#
# [c]
#   Matches a single character, or a sequence of <em>n</em> characters if a
#   field width of <em>n</em> is specified. The usual skip of leading white
#   space is suppressed. To skip white space first, use an explicit space in
#   the format.
#
# [[]
#   Matches a nonempty sequence of characters from the specified set
#   of accepted characters.  The usual skip of leading white space is
#   suppressed.  This bracketed sub-expression is interpreted exactly like a
#   character class in a Ruby regular expression.  (In fact, it is placed as-is
#   in a regular expression.)  The matching against the input string ends with
#   the appearance of a character not in (or, with a circumflex, in) the set,
#   or when the field width runs out, whichever comes first.
#
# === Assignment suppression
#
# To require that a particular match occur, but without including the result
# in the return array, place the <b>assignment suppression flag</b>, which is
# the star character ('*'), immediately after the leading '%' of a format
# specifier (just before the field width, if any).
#
# == scanf for Ruby compared with scanf in C
#
# scanf for Ruby is based on the C function scanf(3), but with modifications,
# dictated mainly by the underlying differences between the languages.
#
# === Unimplemented flags and specifiers
#
# * The only flag implemented in scanf for Ruby is '<tt>*</tt>' (ignore
#   upcoming conversion).  Many of the flags available in C versions of
#   scanf(3) have to do with the type of upcoming pointer arguments, and are
#   meaningless in Ruby.
#
# * The <tt>n</tt> specifier (store number of characters consumed so far in
#   next pointer) is not implemented.
#
# * The <tt>p</tt> specifier (match a pointer value) is not implemented.
#
# === Altered specifiers
#
# [o, u, x, X]
#   In scanf for Ruby, all of these specifiers scan for an optionally signed
#   integer, rather than for an unsigned integer like their C counterparts.
#
# === Return values
#
# scanf for Ruby returns an array of successful conversions, whereas
# scanf(3) returns the number of conversions successfully
# completed. (See below for more details on scanf for Ruby's return
# values.)
#
# == Return values
#
# Without a block, scanf returns an array containing all the conversions
# it has found.  If none are found, scanf will return an empty array. An
# unsuccessful match is never ignored, but rather always signals the end
# of the scanning operation.  If the first unsuccessful match takes place
# after one or more successful matches have already taken place, the
# returned array will contain the results of those successful matches.
#
# With a block scanf returns a 'map'-like array of transformations from
# the block -- that is, an array reflecting what the block did with each
# yielded result from the iterative scanf operation.  (See "Block
# usage", above.)
#
# == Current limitations and bugs
#
# When using IO#scanf under Windows, make sure you open your files in
# binary mode:
#
#     File.open("filename", "rb")
#
# so that scanf can keep track of characters correctly.
#
# Support for character classes is reasonably complete (since it
# essentially piggy-backs on Ruby's regular expression handling of
# character classes), but users are advised that character class testing
# has not been exhaustive, and that they should exercise some caution
# in using any of the more complex and/or arcane character class
# idioms.

  # ==Technical notes
  #
  # ===Rationale behind scanf for Ruby
  #
  # The impetus for a scanf implementation in Ruby comes chiefly from the fact
  # that existing pattern matching operations, such as Regexp#match and
  # String#scan, return all results as strings, which have to be converted to
  # integers or floats explicitly in cases where what's ultimately wanted are
  # integer or float values.
  #
  # ===Design of scanf for Ruby
  #
  # scanf for Ruby is essentially a <format string>-to-<regular
  # expression> converter.
  #
  # When scanf is called, a FormatString object is generated from the
  # format string ("%d%s...") argument. The FormatString object breaks the
  # format string down into atoms ("%d", "%5f", "blah", etc.), and from
  # each atom it creates a FormatSpecifier object, which it
  # saves.
  #
  # Each FormatSpecifier has a regular expression fragment and a "handler"
  # associated with it. For example, the regular expression fragment
  # associated with the format "%d" is "([-+]?\d+)", and the handler
  # associated with it is a wrapper around String#to_i. scanf itself calls
  # FormatString#match, passing in the input string. FormatString#match
  # iterates through its FormatSpecifiers; for each one, it matches the
  # corresponding regular expression fragment against the string. If
  # there's a match, it sends the matched string to the handler associated
  # with the FormatSpecifier.
  #
  # Thus, to follow up the "%d" example: if "123" occurs in the input
  # string when a FormatSpecifier consisting of "%d" is reached, the "123"
  # will be matched against "([-+]?\d+)", and the matched string will be
  # rendered into an integer by a call to to_i.
  #
  # The rendered match is then saved to an accumulator array, and the
  # input string is reduced to the post-match substring. Thus the string
  # is "eaten" from the left as the FormatSpecifiers are applied in
  # sequence.  (This is done to a duplicate string; the original string is
  # not altered.)
  #
  # As soon as a regular expression fragment fails to match the string, or
  # when the FormatString object runs out of FormatSpecifiers, scanning
  # stops and results accumulated so far are returned in an array.
