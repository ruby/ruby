# = csv.rb -- CSV Reading and Writing
#
# Created by James Edward Gray II on 2005-10-31.
#
# See CSV for documentation.
#
# == Description
#
# Welcome to the new and improved CSV.
#
# This version of the CSV library began its life as FasterCSV. FasterCSV was
# intended as a replacement to Ruby's then standard CSV library. It was
# designed to address concerns users of that library had and it had three
# primary goals:
#
# 1.  Be significantly faster than CSV while remaining a pure Ruby library.
# 2.  Use a smaller and easier to maintain code base. (FasterCSV eventually
#     grew larger, was also but considerably richer in features. The parsing
#     core remains quite small.)
# 3.  Improve on the CSV interface.
#
# Obviously, the last one is subjective. I did try to defer to the original
# interface whenever I didn't have a compelling reason to change it though, so
# hopefully this won't be too radically different.
#
# We must have met our goals because FasterCSV was renamed to CSV and replaced
# the original library as of Ruby 1.9. If you are migrating code from 1.8 or
# earlier, you may have to change your code to comply with the new interface.
#
# == What's the Different From the Old CSV?
#
# I'm sure I'll miss something, but I'll try to mention most of the major
# differences I am aware of, to help others quickly get up to speed:
#
# === \CSV Parsing
#
# * This parser is m17n aware. See CSV for full details.
# * This library has a stricter parser and will throw MalformedCSVErrors on
#   problematic data.
# * This library has a less liberal idea of a line ending than CSV. What you
#   set as the <tt>:row_sep</tt> is law. It can auto-detect your line endings
#   though.
# * The old library returned empty lines as <tt>[nil]</tt>. This library calls
#   them <tt>[]</tt>.
# * This library has a much faster parser.
#
# === Interface
#
# * CSV now uses keyword parameters to set options.
# * CSV no longer has generate_row() or parse_row().
# * The old CSV's Reader and Writer classes have been dropped.
# * CSV::open() is now more like Ruby's open().
# * CSV objects now support most standard IO methods.
# * CSV now has a new() method used to wrap objects like String and IO for
#   reading and writing.
# * CSV::generate() is different from the old method.
# * CSV no longer supports partial reads. It works line-by-line.
# * CSV no longer allows the instance methods to override the separators for
#   performance reasons. They must be set in the constructor.
#
# If you use this library and find yourself missing any functionality I have
# trimmed, please {let me know}[mailto:james@grayproductions.net].
#
# == Documentation
#
# See CSV for documentation.
#
# == What is CSV, really?
#
# CSV maintains a pretty strict definition of CSV taken directly from
# {the RFC}[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt]. I relax the rules in only one
# place and that is to make using this library easier. CSV will parse all valid
# CSV.
#
# What you don't want to do is to feed CSV invalid data. Because of the way the
# CSV format works, it's common for a parser to need to read until the end of
# the file to be sure a field is invalid. This consumes a lot of time and memory.
#
# Luckily, when working with invalid CSV, Ruby's built-in methods will almost
# always be superior in every way. For example, parsing non-quoted fields is as
# easy as:
#
#   data.split(",")
#

# == \CSV
#
# === In a Hurry?
#
# If you are familiar with \CSV data and have a particular task in mind,
# you may want to go directly to the:
# - {Recipes for CSV}[doc/csv/recipes/recipes_rdoc.html].
#
# Otherwise, read on here, about the API: classes, methods, and constants.
#
# === \CSV Data
#
# \CSV (comma-separated values) data is a text representation of a table:
# - A _row_ _separator_ delimits table rows.
#   A common row separator is the newline character <tt>"\n"</tt>.
# - A _column_ _separator_ delimits fields in a row.
#   A common column separator is the comma character <tt>","</tt>.
#
# This \CSV \String, with row separator <tt>"\n"</tt>
# and column separator <tt>","</tt>,
# has three rows and two columns:
#   "foo,0\nbar,1\nbaz,2\n"
#
# Despite the name \CSV, a \CSV representation can use different separators.
#
# For more about tables, see the Wikipedia article
# "{Table (information)}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)]",
# especially its section
# "{Simple table}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)#Simple_table]"
#
# == \Class \CSV
#
# Class \CSV provides methods for:
# - Parsing \CSV data from a \String object, a \File (via its file path), or an \IO object.
# - Generating \CSV data to a \String object.
#
# To make \CSV available:
#   require 'csv'
#
# All examples here assume that this has been done.
#
# == Keeping It Simple
#
# A \CSV object has dozens of instance methods that offer fine-grained control
# of parsing and generating \CSV data.
# For many needs, though, simpler approaches will do.
#
# This section summarizes the singleton methods in \CSV
# that allow you to parse and generate without explicitly
# creating \CSV objects.
# For details, follow the links.
#
# === Simple Parsing
#
# Parsing methods commonly return either of:
# - An \Array of Arrays of Strings:
#   - The outer \Array is the entire "table".
#   - Each inner \Array is a row.
#   - Each \String is a field.
# - A CSV::Table object.  For details, see
#   {\CSV with Headers}[#class-CSV-label-CSV+with+Headers].
#
# ==== Parsing a \String
#
# The input to be parsed can be a string:
#   string = "foo,0\nbar,1\nbaz,2\n"
#
# \Method CSV.parse returns the entire \CSV data:
#   CSV.parse(string) # => [["foo", "0"], ["bar", "1"], ["baz", "2"]]
#
# \Method CSV.parse_line returns only the first row:
#   CSV.parse_line(string) # => ["foo", "0"]
#
# \CSV extends class \String with instance method String#parse_csv,
# which also returns only the first row:
#   string.parse_csv # => ["foo", "0"]
#
# ==== Parsing Via a \File Path
#
# The input to be parsed can be in a file:
#   string = "foo,0\nbar,1\nbaz,2\n"
#   path = 't.csv'
#   File.write(path, string)
#
# \Method CSV.read returns the entire \CSV data:
#  CSV.read(path) # => [["foo", "0"], ["bar", "1"], ["baz", "2"]]
#
# \Method CSV.foreach iterates, passing each row to the given block:
#  CSV.foreach(path) do |row|
#    p row
#  end
# Output:
#   ["foo", "0"]
#   ["bar", "1"]
#   ["baz", "2"]
#
# \Method CSV.table returns the entire \CSV data as a CSV::Table object:
#   CSV.table(path) # => #<CSV::Table mode:col_or_row row_count:3>
#
# ==== Parsing from an Open \IO Stream
#
# The input to be parsed can be in an open \IO stream:
#
# \Method CSV.read returns the entire \CSV data:
#   File.open(path) do |file|
#     CSV.read(file)
#   end # => [["foo", "0"], ["bar", "1"], ["baz", "2"]]
#
# As does method CSV.parse:
#   File.open(path) do |file|
#     CSV.parse(file)
#   end # => [["foo", "0"], ["bar", "1"], ["baz", "2"]]
#
# \Method CSV.parse_line returns only the first row:
#   File.open(path) do |file|
#    CSV.parse_line(file)
#   end # => ["foo", "0"]
#
# \Method CSV.foreach iterates, passing each row to the given block:
#   File.open(path) do |file|
#     CSV.foreach(file) do |row|
#       p row
#     end
#   end
# Output:
#   ["foo", "0"]
#   ["bar", "1"]
#   ["baz", "2"]
#
# \Method CSV.table returns the entire \CSV data as a CSV::Table object:
#   File.open(path) do |file|
#     CSV.table(file)
#   end # => #<CSV::Table mode:col_or_row row_count:3>
#
# === Simple Generating
#
# \Method CSV.generate returns a \String;
# this example uses method CSV#<< to append the rows
# that are to be generated:
#   output_string = CSV.generate do |csv|
#     csv << ['foo', 0]
#     csv << ['bar', 1]
#     csv << ['baz', 2]
#   end
#   output_string # => "foo,0\nbar,1\nbaz,2\n"
#
# \Method CSV.generate_line returns a \String containing the single row
# constructed from an \Array:
#   CSV.generate_line(['foo', '0']) # => "foo,0\n"
#
# \CSV extends class \Array with instance method <tt>Array#to_csv</tt>,
# which forms an \Array into a \String:
#   ['foo', '0'].to_csv # => "foo,0\n"
#
# === "Filtering" \CSV
#
# \Method CSV.filter provides a Unix-style filter for \CSV data.
# The input data is processed to form the output data:
#   in_string = "foo,0\nbar,1\nbaz,2\n"
#   out_string = ''
#   CSV.filter(in_string, out_string) do |row|
#     row[0] = row[0].upcase
#     row[1] *= 4
#   end
#   out_string # => "FOO,0000\nBAR,1111\nBAZ,2222\n"
#
# == \CSV Objects
#
# There are three ways to create a \CSV object:
# - \Method CSV.new returns a new \CSV object.
# - \Method CSV.instance returns a new or cached \CSV object.
# - \Method \CSV() also returns a new or cached \CSV object.
#
# === Instance Methods
#
# \CSV has three groups of instance methods:
# - Its own internally defined instance methods.
# - Methods included by module Enumerable.
# - Methods delegated to class IO. See below.
#
# ==== Delegated Methods
#
# For convenience, a CSV object will delegate to many methods in class IO.
# (A few have wrapper "guard code" in \CSV.) You may call:
# * IO#binmode
# * #binmode?
# * IO#close
# * IO#close_read
# * IO#close_write
# * IO#closed?
# * #eof
# * #eof?
# * IO#external_encoding
# * IO#fcntl
# * IO#fileno
# * #flock
# * IO#flush
# * IO#fsync
# * IO#internal_encoding
# * #ioctl
# * IO#isatty
# * #path
# * IO#pid
# * IO#pos
# * IO#pos=
# * IO#reopen
# * #rewind
# * IO#seek
# * #stat
# * IO#string
# * IO#sync
# * IO#sync=
# * IO#tell
# * #to_i
# * #to_io
# * IO#truncate
# * IO#tty?
#
# === Options
#
# The default values for options are:
#   DEFAULT_OPTIONS = {
#     # For both parsing and generating.
#     col_sep:            ",",
#     row_sep:            :auto,
#     quote_char:         '"',

#     write_converters:   nil,
#     write_nil_value:    nil,
#     write_empty_value:  "",
#   }

#
# === \CSV with Headers
#
# CSV allows to specify column names of CSV file, whether they are in data, or
# provided separately. If headers are specified, reading methods return an instance
# of CSV::Table, consisting of CSV::Row.
#
#   # Headers are part of data
#   data = CSV.parse(<<~ROWS, headers: true)
#     Name,Department,Salary
#     Bob,Engineering,1000
#     Jane,Sales,2000
#     John,Management,5000
#   ROWS
#
#   data.class      #=> CSV::Table
#   data.first      #=> #<CSV::Row "Name":"Bob" "Department":"Engineering" "Salary":"1000">
#   data.first.to_h #=> {"Name"=>"Bob", "Department"=>"Engineering", "Salary"=>"1000"}
#
#   # Headers provided by developer
#   data = CSV.parse('Bob,Engineering,1000', headers: %i[name department salary])
#   data.first      #=> #<CSV::Row name:"Bob" department:"Engineering" salary:"1000">
#
# === \Converters
#
# By default, each value (field or header) parsed by \CSV is formed into a \String.
# You can use a _field_ _converter_ or  _header_ _converter_
# to intercept and modify the parsed values:
# - See {Field Converters}[#class-CSV-label-Field+Converters].
# - See {Header Converters}[#class-CSV-label-Header+Converters].
#
# Also by default, each value to be written during generation is written 'as-is'.
# You can use a _write_ _converter_ to modify values before writing.
# - See {Write Converters}[#class-CSV-label-Write+Converters].
#
# ==== Specifying \Converters
#
# You can specify converters for parsing or generating in the +options+
# argument to various \CSV methods:
# - Option +converters+ for converting parsed field values.
# - Option +header_converters+ for converting parsed header values.
# - Option +write_converters+ for converting values to be written (generated).
#
# There are three forms for specifying converters:
# - A converter proc: executable code to be used for conversion.
# - A converter name: the name of a stored converter.
# - A converter list: an array of converter procs, converter names, and converter lists.
#
# ===== Converter Procs
#
# This converter proc, +strip_converter+, accepts a value +field+
# and returns <tt>field.strip</tt>:
#   strip_converter = proc {|field| field.strip }
# In this call to <tt>CSV.parse</tt>,
# the keyword argument <tt>converters: string_converter</tt>
# specifies that:
# - \Proc +string_converter+ is to be called for each parsed field.
# - The converter's return value is to replace the +field+ value.
# Example:
#   string = " foo , 0 \n bar , 1 \n baz , 2 \n"
#   array = CSV.parse(string, converters: strip_converter)
#   array # => [["foo", "0"], ["bar", "1"], ["baz", "2"]]
#
# A converter proc can receive a second argument, +field_info+,
# that contains details about the field.
# This modified +strip_converter+ displays its arguments:
#   strip_converter = proc do |field, field_info|
#     p [field, field_info]
#     field.strip
#   end
#   string = " foo , 0 \n bar , 1 \n baz , 2 \n"
#   array = CSV.parse(string, converters: strip_converter)
#   array # => [["foo", "0"], ["bar", "1"], ["baz", "2"]]
# Output:
#  [" foo ", #<struct CSV::FieldInfo index=0, line=1, header=nil>]
#  [" 0 ", #<struct CSV::FieldInfo index=1, line=1, header=nil>]
#  [" bar ", #<struct CSV::FieldInfo index=0, line=2, header=nil>]
#  [" 1 ", #<struct CSV::FieldInfo index=1, line=2, header=nil>]
#  [" baz ", #<struct CSV::FieldInfo index=0, line=3, header=nil>]
#  [" 2 ", #<struct CSV::FieldInfo index=1, line=3, header=nil>]
# Each CSV::FieldInfo object shows:
# - The 0-based field index.
# - The 1-based line index.
# - The field header, if any.
#
# ===== Stored \Converters
#
# A converter may be given a name and stored in a structure where
# the parsing methods can find it by name.
#
# The storage structure for field converters is the \Hash CSV::Converters.
# It has several built-in converter procs:
# - <tt>:integer</tt>: converts each \String-embedded integer into a true \Integer.
# - <tt>:float</tt>: converts each \String-embedded float into a true \Float.
# - <tt>:date</tt>: converts each \String-embedded date into a true \Date.
# - <tt>:date_time</tt>: converts each \String-embedded date-time into a true \DateTime
# .
# This example creates a converter proc, then stores it:
#   strip_converter = proc {|field| field.strip }
#   CSV::Converters[:strip] = strip_converter
# Then the parsing method call can refer to the converter
# by its name, <tt>:strip</tt>:
#   string = " foo , 0 \n bar , 1 \n baz , 2 \n"
#   array = CSV.parse(string, converters: :strip)
#   array # => [["foo", "0"], ["bar", "1"], ["baz", "2"]]
#
# The storage structure for header converters is the \Hash CSV::HeaderConverters,
# which works in the same way.
# It also has built-in converter procs:
# - <tt>:downcase</tt>: Downcases each header.
# - <tt>:symbol</tt>: Converts each header to a \Symbol.
#
# There is no such storage structure for write headers.
#
# In order for the parsing methods to access stored converters in non-main-Ractors, the
# storage structure must be made shareable first.
# Therefore, <tt>Ractor.make_shareable(CSV::Converters)</tt> and
# <tt>Ractor.make_shareable(CSV::HeaderConverters)</tt> must be called before the creation
# of Ractors that use the converters stored in these structures. (Since making the storage
# structures shareable involves freezing them, any custom converters that are to be used
# must be added first.)
#
# ===== Converter Lists
#
# A _converter_ _list_ is an \Array that may include any assortment of:
# - Converter procs.
# - Names of stored converters.
# - Nested converter lists.
#
# Examples:
#   numeric_converters = [:integer, :float]
#   date_converters = [:date, :date_time]
#   [numeric_converters, strip_converter]
#   [strip_converter, date_converters, :float]
#
# Like a converter proc, a converter list may be named and stored in either
# \CSV::Converters or CSV::HeaderConverters:
#   CSV::Converters[:custom] = [strip_converter, date_converters, :float]
#   CSV::HeaderConverters[:custom] = [:downcase, :symbol]
#
# There are two built-in converter lists:
#   CSV::Converters[:numeric] # => [:integer, :float]
#   CSV::Converters[:all] # => [:date_time, :numeric]
#
# ==== Field \Converters
#
# With no conversion, all parsed fields in all rows become Strings:
#   string = "foo,0\nbar,1\nbaz,2\n"
#   ary = CSV.parse(string)
#   ary # => # => [["foo", "0"], ["bar", "1"], ["baz", "2"]]
#
# When you specify a field converter, each parsed field is passed to the converter;
# its return value becomes the stored value for the field.
# A converter might, for example, convert an integer embedded in a \String
# into a true \Integer.
# (In fact, that's what built-in field converter +:integer+ does.)
#
# There are three ways to use field \converters.
#
# - Using option {converters}[#class-CSV-label-Option+converters] with a parsing method:
#     ary = CSV.parse(string, converters: :integer)
#     ary # => [0, 1, 2] # => [["foo", 0], ["bar", 1], ["baz", 2]]
# - Using option {converters}[#class-CSV-label-Option+converters] with a new \CSV instance:
#     csv = CSV.new(string, converters: :integer)
#     # Field converters in effect:
#     csv.converters # => [:integer]
#     csv.read # => [["foo", 0], ["bar", 1], ["baz", 2]]
# - Using method #convert to add a field converter to a \CSV instance:
#     csv = CSV.new(string)
#     # Add a converter.
#     csv.convert(:integer)
#     csv.converters # => [:integer]
#     csv.read # => [["foo", 0], ["bar", 1], ["baz", 2]]
#
# Installing a field converter does not affect already-read rows:
#   csv = CSV.new(string)
#   csv.shift # => ["foo", "0"]
#   # Add a converter.
#   csv.convert(:integer)
#   csv.converters # => [:integer]
#   csv.read # => [["bar", 1], ["baz", 2]]
#
# There are additional built-in \converters, and custom \converters are also supported.
#
# ===== Built-In Field \Converters
#
# The built-in field converters are in \Hash CSV::Converters:
# - Each key is a field converter name.
# - Each value is one of:
#   - A \Proc field converter.
#   - An \Array of field converter names.
#
# Display:
#   CSV::Converters.each_pair do |name, value|
#     if value.kind_of?(Proc)
#       p [name, value.class]
#     else
#       p [name, value]
#     end
#   end

#   # Without the converter
#   csv = CSV.parse_line(data)
#   csv # => ["0", "1", "2", "x"]
#   # With the converter
#   csv = CSV.parse_line(data, converters: :integer)
#   csv # => [0, 1, 2, "x"]
#
# Converter +:float+ converts each field that Float() accepts:

#   # Without the converter
#   csv = CSV.parse_line(data)

#   # With the converter
#   csv = CSV.parse_line(data, converters: :float)

#   csv.converters # => []
#   csv.convert(:integer)
#   csv.converters # => [:integer]
#   csv.convert(:date)
#   csv.converters # => [:integer, :date]
#
# ===== Custom Field \Converters
#
# You can define a custom field converter:
#   strip_converter = proc {|field| field.strip }
#   string = " foo , 0 \n bar , 1 \n baz , 2 \n"
#   array = CSV.parse(string, converters: strip_converter)
#   array # => [["foo", "0"], ["bar", "1"], ["baz", "2"]]
# You can register the converter in \Converters \Hash,
# which allows you to refer to it by name:
#   CSV::Converters[:strip] = strip_converter
#   string = " foo , 0 \n bar , 1 \n baz , 2 \n"
#   array = CSV.parse(string, converters: :strip)
#   array # => [["foo", "0"], ["bar", "1"], ["baz", "2"]]
#
# ==== Header \Converters
#
# Header converters operate only on headers (and not on other rows).
#
# There are three ways to use header \converters;
# these examples use built-in header converter +:downcase+,
# which downcases each parsed header.
#
# - Option +header_converters+ with a singleton parsing method:
#     string = "Name,Count\nFoo,0\n,Bar,1\nBaz,2"
#     tbl = CSV.parse(string, headers: true, header_converters: :downcase)
#     tbl.class # => CSV::Table
#     tbl.headers # => ["name", "count"]
#
# - Option +header_converters+ with a new \CSV instance:
#     csv = CSV.new(string, header_converters: :downcase)
#     # Header converters in effect:
#     csv.header_converters # => [:downcase]
#     tbl = CSV.parse(string, headers: true)
#     tbl.headers # => ["Name", "Count"]
#
# - Method #header_convert adds a header converter to a \CSV instance:
#     csv = CSV.new(string)
#     # Add a header converter.
#     csv.header_convert(:downcase)
#     csv.header_converters # => [:downcase]
#     tbl = CSV.parse(string, headers: true)
#     tbl.headers # => ["Name", "Count"]
#
# ===== Built-In Header \Converters
#
# The built-in header \converters are in \Hash CSV::HeaderConverters.
# The keys there are the names of the \converters:
#   CSV::HeaderConverters.keys # => [:downcase, :symbol]
#
# Converter +:downcase+ converts each header by downcasing it:
#   string = "Name,Count\nFoo,0\n,Bar,1\nBaz,2"
#   tbl = CSV.parse(string, headers: true, header_converters: :downcase)
#   tbl.class # => CSV::Table
#   tbl.headers # => ["name", "count"]
#
# Converter +:symbol+ converts each header by making it into a \Symbol:
#   string = "Name,Count\nFoo,0\n,Bar,1\nBaz,2"
#   tbl = CSV.parse(string, headers: true, header_converters: :symbol)
#   tbl.headers # => [:name, :count]
# Details:
# - Strips leading and trailing whitespace.
# - Downcases the header.
# - Replaces embedded spaces with underscores.
# - Removes non-word characters.
# - Makes the string into a \Symbol.
#
# ===== Custom Header \Converters
#
# You can define a custom header converter:
#   upcase_converter = proc {|header| header.upcase }
#   string = "Name,Value\nfoo,0\nbar,1\nbaz,2\n"
#   table = CSV.parse(string, headers: true, header_converters: upcase_converter)
#   table # => #<CSV::Table mode:col_or_row row_count:4>
#   table.headers # => ["NAME", "VALUE"]
# You can register the converter in \HeaderConverters \Hash,
# which allows you to refer to it by name:
#   CSV::HeaderConverters[:upcase] = upcase_converter
#   table = CSV.parse(string, headers: true, header_converters: :upcase)
#   table # => #<CSV::Table mode:col_or_row row_count:4>
#   table.headers # => ["NAME", "VALUE"]
#
# ===== Write \Converters
#
# When you specify a write converter for generating \CSV,
# each field to be written is passed to the converter;
# its return value becomes the new value for the field.
# A converter might, for example, strip whitespace from a field.
#
# Using no write converter (all fields unmodified):
#   output_string = CSV.generate do |csv|
#     csv << [' foo ', 0]
#     csv << [' bar ', 1]
#     csv << [' baz ', 2]
#   end
#   output_string # => " foo ,0\n bar ,1\n baz ,2\n"
# Using option +write_converters+ with two custom write converters:
#   strip_converter = proc {|field| field.respond_to?(:strip) ? field.strip : field }
#   upcase_converter = proc {|field| field.respond_to?(:upcase) ? field.upcase : field }
#   write_converters = [strip_converter, upcase_converter]
#   output_string = CSV.generate(write_converters: write_converters) do |csv|
#     csv << [' foo ', 0]
#     csv << [' bar ', 1]
#     csv << [' baz ', 2]
#   end
#   output_string # => "FOO,0\nBAR,1\nBAZ,2\n"
#
# === Character Encodings (M17n or Multilingualization)
#
# This new CSV parser is m17n savvy.  The parser works in the Encoding of the IO
# or String object being read from or written to. Your data is never transcoded
# (unless you ask Ruby to transcode it for you) and will literally be parsed in
# the Encoding it is in. Thus CSV will return Arrays or Rows of Strings in the
# Encoding of your data. This is accomplished by transcoding the parser itself
# into your Encoding.
#
# Some transcoding must take place, of course, to accomplish this multiencoding
# support. For example, <tt>:col_sep</tt>, <tt>:row_sep</tt>, and
# <tt>:quote_char</tt> must be transcoded to match your data.  Hopefully this
# makes the entire process feel transparent, since CSV's defaults should just
# magically work for your data. However, you can set these values manually in
# the target Encoding to avoid the translation.
#
# It's also important to note that while all of CSV's core parser is now
# Encoding agnostic, some features are not. For example, the built-in
# converters will try to transcode data to UTF-8 before making conversions.
# Again, you can provide custom converters that are aware of your Encodings to
# avoid this translation. It's just too hard for me to support native
# conversions in all of Ruby's Encodings.
#
# Anyway, the practical side of this is simple: make sure IO and String objects
# passed into CSV have the proper Encoding set and everything should just work.
# CSV methods that allow you to open IO objects (CSV::foreach(), CSV::open(),
# CSV::read(), and CSV::readlines()) do allow you to specify the Encoding.
#
# One minor exception comes when generating CSV into a String with an Encoding
# that is not ASCII compatible. There's no existing data for CSV to use to
# prepare itself and thus you will probably need to manually specify the desired
# Encoding for most of those cases. It will try to guess using the fields in a
# row of output though, when using CSV::generate_line() or Array#to_csv().
#
# I try to point out any other Encoding issues in the documentation of methods
# as they come up.
#
# This has been tested to the best of my ability with all non-"dummy" Encodings
# Ruby ships with. However, it is brave new code and may have some bugs.
# Please feel free to {report}[mailto:james@grayproductions.net] any issues you
# find with it.
