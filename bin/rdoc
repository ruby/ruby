## Transitional Hack ####
#
#  RDoc was initially distributed independently, and installed
#  itself into <prefix>/lib/ruby/site_ruby/<ver>/rdoc...
#
#  Now that RDoc is part of the distribution, it's installed into
#  <prefix>/lib/ruby/<ver>, which unfortunately appears later in the
#  search path. This means that if you have previously installed RDoc,
#  and then install from ruby-lang, you'll pick up the old one by
#  default. This hack checks for the condition, and readjusts the
#  search path if necessary.

def adjust_for_existing_rdoc(path)
  
  $stderr.puts %{
  It seems as if you have a previously-installed RDoc in
  the directory #{path}.

  Because this is now out-of-date, you might want to consider
  removing the directories:

    #{File.join(path, "rdoc")}

  and

    #{File.join(path, "markup")}

  }

  # Move all the site_ruby directories to the end
  p $:
  $:.replace($:.partition {|path| /site_ruby/ !~ path}.flatten)
  p $:
end

$:.each do |path|
  if /site_ruby/ =~ path 
    rdoc_path = File.join(path, 'rdoc', 'rdoc.rb')
    if File.exists?(rdoc_path)
      adjust_for_existing_rdoc(path)
      break
    end
  end
end
