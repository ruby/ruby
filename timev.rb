# A \Time object represents a date and time:
#
#   Time.new(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0) # => 2000-01-01 00:00:00 -0600
#
# Although its value can be expressed as a single numeric
# (see {Epoch Seconds}[rdoc-ref:Time@Epoch+Seconds] below),
# it can be convenient to deal with the value by parts:
#
#   t = Time.new(-2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.0)
#   # => -2000-01-01 00:00:00 -0600
#   t.year # => -2000
#   t.month # => 1
#   t.mday # => 1
#   t.hour # => 0
#   t.min # => 0
#   t.sec # => 0
#   t.subsec # => 0
#
#   t = Time.new(2000, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59.5)
#   # => 2000-12-31 23:59:59.5 -0600
#   t.year # => 2000
#   t.month # => 12
#   t.mday # => 31
#   t.hour # => 23
#   t.min # => 59
#   t.sec # => 59
#   t.subsec # => (1/2)
#
# == Epoch Seconds
#
# <i>Epoch seconds</i> is the exact number of seconds
# (including fractional subseconds) since the Unix Epoch, January 1, 1970.
#
# You can retrieve that value exactly using method Time.to_r:
#
#   Time.at(0).to_r        # => (0/1)
#   Time.at(0.999999).to_r # => (9007190247541737/9007199254740992)
#
# Other retrieval methods such as Time#to_i and Time#to_f
# may return a value that rounds or truncates subseconds.
#
# == \Time Resolution
#
# A \Time object derived from the system clock
# (for example, by method Time.now)
# has the resolution supported by the system.
#
# == Examples
#
# All of these examples were done using the EST timezone which is GMT-5.
#
# === Creating a New \Time Instance
#
# You can create a new instance of Time with Time.new. This will use the
# current system time. Time.now is an alias for this. You can also
# pass parts of the time to Time.new such as year, month, minute, etc. When
# you want to construct a time this way you must pass at least a year. If you
# pass the year with nothing else time will default to January 1 of that year
# at 00:00:00 with the current system timezone. Here are some examples:
#
#   Time.new(2002)         #=> 2002-01-01 00:00:00 -0500
#   Time.new(2002, 10)     #=> 2002-10-01 00:00:00 -0500
#   Time.new(2002, 10, 31) #=> 2002-10-31 00:00:00 -0500
#
# You can pass a UTC offset:
#
#   Time.new(2002, 10, 31, 2, 2, 2, "+02:00") #=> 2002-10-31 02:02:02 +0200
#
# Or a timezone object:
#
#   zone = timezone("Europe/Athens")      # Eastern European Time, UTC+2
#   Time.new(2002, 10, 31, 2, 2, 2, zone) #=> 2002-10-31 02:02:02 +0200
#
# You can also use Time.local and Time.utc to infer
# local and UTC timezones instead of using the current system
# setting.
#
# You can also create a new time using Time.at which takes the number of
# seconds (with subsecond) since the {Unix
# Epoch}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time].
#
#   Time.at(628232400) #=> 1989-11-28 00:00:00 -0500
#
# === Working with an Instance of \Time
#
# Once you have an instance of Time there is a multitude of things you can
# do with it. Below are some examples. For all of the following examples, we
# will work on the assumption that you have done the following:
#
#   t = Time.new(1993, 02, 24, 12, 0, 0, "+09:00")
#
# Was that a monday?
#
#   t.monday? #=> false
#
# What year was that again?
#
#   t.year #=> 1993
#
# Was it daylight savings at the time?
#
#   t.dst? #=> false
#
# What's the day a year later?
#
#   t + (60*60*24*365) #=> 1994-02-24 12:00:00 +0900
#
# How many seconds was that since the Unix Epoch?
#
#   t.to_i #=> 730522800
#
# You can also do standard functions like compare two times.
#
#   t1 = Time.new(2010)
#   t2 = Time.new(2011)
#
#   t1 == t2 #=> false
#   t1 == t1 #=> true
#   t1 <  t2 #=> true
#   t1 >  t2 #=> false
#
#   Time.new(2010,10,31).between?(t1, t2) #=> true
#
