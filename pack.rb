class Array
  #  call-seq:
  #     arr.pack( aTemplateString ) -> aBinaryString
  #     arr.pack( aTemplateString, buffer: aBufferString ) -> aBufferString
  #
  #  Packs the contents of <i>arr</i> into a binary sequence according to
  #  the directives in <i>aTemplateString</i> (see the table below)
  #  Directives ``A,'' ``a,'' and ``Z'' may be followed by a count,
  #  which gives the width of the resulting field. The remaining
  #  directives also may take a count, indicating the number of array
  #  elements to convert. If the count is an asterisk
  #  (``<code>*</code>''), all remaining array elements will be
  #  converted. Any of the directives ``<code>sSiIlL</code>'' may be
  #  followed by an underscore (``<code>_</code>'') or
  #  exclamation mark (``<code>!</code>'') to use the underlying
  #  platform's native size for the specified type; otherwise, they use a
  #  platform-independent size. Spaces are ignored in the template
  #  string. See also String#unpack.
  #
  #     a = [ "a", "b", "c" ]
  #     n = [ 65, 66, 67 ]
  #     a.pack("A3A3A3")   #=> "a  b  c  "
  #     a.pack("a3a3a3")   #=> "a\000\000b\000\000c\000\000"
  #     n.pack("ccc")      #=> "ABC"
  #
  #  If <i>aBufferString</i> is specified and its capacity is enough,
  #  +pack+ uses it as the buffer and returns it.
  #  When the offset is specified by the beginning of <i>aTemplateString</i>,
  #  the result is filled after the offset.
  #  If original contents of <i>aBufferString</i> exists and it's longer than
  #  the offset, the rest of <i>offsetOfBuffer</i> are overwritten by the result.
  #  If it's shorter, the gap is filled with ``<code>\0</code>''.
  #
  #  Note that ``buffer:'' option does not guarantee not to allocate memory
  #  in +pack+.  If the capacity of <i>aBufferString</i> is not enough,
  #  +pack+ allocates memory.
