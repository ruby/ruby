This version differs from the one in r25359 because there are several tests which currently fail on 1.8.6 because those capabilities are not implemented. Those tests are commented out. r28229

Thu May 26 02:15:00 2010 Kirk Haines <khaines@ruby-lang.org>

	* signal.c: Bug #911 [ruby-core:20723]; this problem exists because Resolv::ResolvTimeout has Interrupt in its ancestry, and Interrupt, which descends from Signal, still used Signal's initialize() method, which requires an argument. Interrupt, however, should not require an argument. This is a backport of r12226 on the 1.8.7 branch, which fixed this problem. r28029

Mon May 25 06:59:00 2010 Kirk Haines <khaines@ruby-lang.org>

Thu May 20 04:10:00 2010 Kirk Haines <khaines@ruby-lang.org>

	* lib/cgi.rb: Backport #229 [ruby-core:17634]; CGI::Cookie objects can get out of sync when CGI::Cookie#value= is used to assign a new value. Also, if a nil value ends up in the array of values for the cookie, CGI::Cookie#to_s would blow up on a gsub error when it tried to CGI::escape the nil value. This is fixed so that nils are treated as empty strings. r27932

Wed Jan 28 04:00:00 2010 Kirk Haines <khaines@ruby-lang.org>

	* io.c: Backport #2009 [ruby-core:25173]; (rb_io_fptr_finalize): free fptr to avoid memory leaks.

	* ChangeLog: My brain got stuck in a bad pattern, and I kept adding new items under the first record for the day. They are all broken out into their own entries like they should be, now, with timestamps pulled from the SVN log.

	* Backport #1975 [ruby-core:25025]; Dir.mktmpdir exists in the rest of the 1.8 line, and it is used in the test suite that goes with backport #1168. It doesn't conflict with any existing 1.8.6 art, and is a pure-ruby addition to Dir, so I backported it to 1.8.6 from 1.8.7.

Mon Aug 3  10:06:00 2009 Kirk Haines <khaines@ruby-lang.org>

Wed Jul 29 17:04:00 2009 Kirk Haines <khaines@ruby-lang.org>

	* ext/tk/extconf.rb: Added some additional paths where TCL files are common found; fixes problems with building on some distributions.

	* ext/digest, test/digest/test_digest.rb: Merge from trunk:
	  - Introduce versioning in Digest::Base API, and prefix C
	    constants with RUBY_ and C type names with rb_ to avoid name
	    clash in writing extensions.
	  - Introduce Digest::Class and Digest::Instance for ease of
	    implementing subclasses and add-ons.
	  - Digest::Instance module requires and assumes that any instance
	    be resettable and clonable.  An instance method #new() is
	    added so digest instances work just like digest classes.
	  - The constructor does no longer take an initial string to feed;
	    digest() and hexdigest() now do, instead.  This allows digest
	    classes to take their own hashing parameters.
	  - Make some changes to digest() and hexdigest() class methods,
	    which now take extra arguments, which are passed through to
	    the constructor in an internal call.
	  - Add #digest_length/size/length() and #block_length(),
	  - Add the Digest::SHA2 class to wrap up SHA2 variants: SHA256,
	    SHA384 and SHA512, hoping this module would make a decent
	    example of a digest subclass written in Ruby.
	  - Rip BubbleBabble support out of the base class and have a
	    separate module named digest/bubblebabble.
	  - Remove RD documents in favor of newly written and embedded
	    RDoc documentation.

	* io.c (READ_PENDING*): Support solaris 64-bit environments.
	  Solaris defines a opaque FILE struct when compiling 64 bit
	  binaries. This means that we dont have access to _ptr etc.
	  members anymore. The solution by Steven Lumos is to define
	  FILE64 that has needed members available. I've modified
	  the origanal patch a bit so that it compiles both with gcc
	  and now free sun studio 11 compiler and both amd64 and sparc.
	  NOTE! We have to 64 bit solaris FILE structure time to time
	  otherwise we'll get breakage.

	  Ruby data.  moved Object#yaml_new into the node_import and made it the
	  default behavior.  the target_class is always called wih yaml_new, prepended

	  formatting.)

	* ext/syck/gram.c: headless documents of any kind allowed.

	* ext/syck/node.c: new syck_replace_str methods and syck_empty_*
	  methods for rewriting node contents, while keeping the ID

	  * let WSDLEncodedRegistry#soap2obj map SOAP/OM to Ruby according to
	    WSDL as well as obj2soap.  closes #70.

	  * let SOAP::Mapping::Object handle XML attribute for doc/lit service.
	    you can set/get XML attribute via accessor methods which as a name
	    'xmlattr_' prefixed (<foo name="bar"/> -> Foo#xmlattr_name).

	  === client side ===

	  * WSDLDriver capitalized name operation bug fixed.  from
	    1.5.3-ruby1.8.2, operation which has capitalized name (such as
	    KeywordSearchRequest in AWS) is defined as a method having
	    uncapitalized name. (converted with GenSupport.safemethodname
	    to handle operation name 'foo-bar').  it introduced serious
	    incompatibility; in the past, it was defined as a capitalized.
	    define capitalized method as well under that circumstance.

	  * added new factory interface 'WSDLDriverFactory#create_rpc_driver'
	    to create RPC::Driver, not WSDLDriver (RPC::Driver and WSDLDriver
	    are merged).  'WSDLDriverFactory#create_driver' still creates
	    WSDLDriver for compatibility but it warns that the method is
	    deprecated.  please use create_rpc_driver instead of create_driver.

	  * allow to use an URI object as an endpoint_url even with net/http,
	    not http-access2.

	  === server side ===

	  * added mod_ruby support to SOAP::CGIStub.  rename a CGI script
	    server.cgi to server.rb and let mod_ruby's RubyHandler handles the
	    script.  CGIStub detects if it's running under mod_ruby environment
	    or not.

	  * added fcgi support to SOAP::CGIStub.  see the sample at
	    sample/soap/calc/server.fcgi.  (almost same as server.cgi but has
	    fcgi handler at the bottom.)

	  * allow to return a SOAPFault object to respond customized SOAP fault.

	  * added the interface 'generate_explicit_type' for server side
	    (CGIStub, HTTPServer).  call 'self.generate_explicit_type = true'
	    if you want to return simplified XML even if it's rpc/encoded
	    service.

	  == WSDL ==

	  === WSDL definition ===

	  * improved XML Schema support such as extension, restriction,
	    simpleType, complexType + simpleContent, ref, length, import,
	    include.

	  * reduced "unknown element/attribute" warnings (warn only 1 time for
	    each QName).

	  * importing XSD file at schemaLocation with xsd:import.

	  === code generation from WSDL ===

	  * generator crashed when there's '-' in defined element/attribute
	    name.

	  * added ApacheMap WSDL definition.

	* sample/{soap,wsdl}: removed.

	* lib/logger.rb: leading 0 padding of timestamp usec part.

	* lib/csv.rb (CSV.parse): [CAUTION] behavior changed.  in the past,
	  CSV.parse accepts a filename to be read-opened (it was just a
	  shortcut of CSV.open(filename, 'r')).  now CSV.parse accepts a
	  string or a stream to be parsed e.g.
	  CSV.parse("1,2\n3,r") #=> [['1', '2'], ['3', '4']]

	* lib/csv.rb: CSV::Row and CSV::Cell are deprecated.  these classes
	  are removed in the future.  in the new csv.rb, row is represented
	  as just an Array.  since CSV::Row was a subclass of Array, it won't
	  hurt almost all programs except one which depended CSV::Row#match.
	  and a cell is represented as just a String or nil(NULL).  this
	  change will cause widespread destruction.

	      CSV.open("foo.csv", "r") do |row|
		row.each do |cell|
		  if cell.is_null       # using Cell#is_null
		    p "(NULL)"
		  else
		    p cell.data         # using Cell#data
		  end
		end
	      end

	    must be just;

	      CSV.open("foo.csv", "r") do |row|
		row.each do |cell|
		  if cell.nil?
		    p "(NULL)"
		  else
		    p cell
		  end
		end
	      end

	* lib/csv.rb: [CAUTION] record separator(CR, LF, CR+LF) behavior
	  change.  CSV.open, CSV.parse, and CSV,generate now do not force
	  opened file binmode.  formerly it set binmode explicitly.

	  with CSV.open, binmode of opened file depends the given mode
	  parameter "r", "w", "rb", and "wb".  CSV.parse and CSV.generate open
	  file with "r" and "w".

	  setting mode properly is user's responsibility now.

	* lib/csv.rb: accepts String as a fs (field separator/column separator)
	  and rs (record separator/row separator)

	* lib/csv.rb (CSV.read, CSV.readlines): added.  works as IO.read and
	  IO.readlines in CSV format.

	* lib/csv.rb: added CSV.foreach(path, rs = nil, &block).  CSV.foreach
	  now does not handle "| cmd" as a path different from IO.foreach.
	  needed?

	* test/csv/test_csv.rb: updated.

	* test/ruby/test_float.rb: added test_strtod to test Float("0").

	  switch on threads smoothly and avoid seg-fault.

	* ext/tcltklib/tcltklib.c: add TclTkIp._thread_vwait and

	  _thread_tkwait.

	* ext/tk/lib/tk.rb: now, TkVariable#wait has 2 arguments.

	  Find it.  :-)

	* lib/soap/rpc/standaloneServer.rb: Set severity threshould to INFO.

	  for DirectoryString, and strongly requires to use UTF8String for

	  variables across THREAD_SAVE_CONTEXT.

Thu Oct  9 12:05:46 2003  Eric Sunshine  <sunshine@sunshineco.com>

	* configure.in: revived NextStep, OpenStep, and Rhapsody ports which
	  had become unbuildable; enhanced --enable-fat-binary option so that
	  it accepts a list of desired architectures (rather than assuming a
	  fixed list), or defaults to a platform-appropriate list if user does
	  not provide an explicit list; made the default list of architectures
	  for MAB (fat binary) more comprehensive; now uses -fno-common even
	  when building the interpreter (in addition to using it for
	  extensions), thus allowing the interpreter to be embedded into a
	  plugin module of an external project (in addition to allowing
	  embedding directly into an application); added checks for
	  <netinet/in_systm.h> (needed by `socket' extension) and getcwd(); now
	  ensures that -I/usr/local/include is employed when extensions'
	  extconf.rb scripts invoke have_header() since extension checks on
	  NextStep and OpenStep will fail without it if the desired resource
	  resides in the /usr/local tree; fixed formatting of --help message.

	* Makefile.in: $(LIBRUBY_A) rule now deletes the archive before
	  invoking $(AR) since `ar' on Apple/NeXT can not "update" MAB archives
	  (see configure's --enable-fat-binary option); added rule for new
	  missing/getcwd.c.

	* defines.h: fixed endian handling during MAB build (see configure's
	  --enable-fat-binary option) to ensure that all portions of the
	  project see the correct WORDS_BIGENDIAN value (some extension modules
	  were getting the wrong endian setting); added missing constants
	  GETPGRP_VOID, WNOHANG, WUNTRACED, X_OK, and type pid_t for NextStep
	  and OpenStep; removed unnecessary and problematic HAVE_SYS_WAIT_H
	  define in NeXT section.

	* dir.c: do not allow NAMLEN() macro to trust dirent::d_namlen on
	  NextStep since, on some installations, this value always resolves
	  uselessly to zero.

	* dln.c: added error reporting to NextStep extension loader since the
	  previous behavior of failing silently was not useful; now ensures
	  that NSLINKMODULE_OPTION_BINDNOW compatibility constant is defined
	  for OpenStep and Rhapsody; no longer includes <mach-o/dyld.h> twice
	  on Rhapsody since this header lacks multiple-include protection,
	  which resulted in "redefinition" compilation errors.

	* main.c: also create hard reference to objc_msgSend() on NeXT
	  platforms (in addition to Apple platforms).

	* lib/mkmf.rb: now exports XCFLAGS from configure script to extension
	  makefiles so that extensions can be built MAB (see configure's
	  --enable-fat-binary option); also utilize XCFLAGS in cc_command()
	  (but not cpp_command() because MAB flags are incompatible with
	  direct invocation of `cpp').

	* ext/curses/extconf.rb: now additionally checks for presence of these
	  curses functions which are not present on NextStep or Openstep:
	  bkgd(), bkgdset(), color(), curs(), getbkgd(), init(), scrl(), set(),
	  setscrreg(), wattroff(), wattron(), wattrset(), wbkgd(), wbkgdset(),
	  wscrl(), wsetscrreg()

	* ext/curses/curses.c: added appropriate #ifdef's for additional set of
	  curses functions now checked by extconf.rb; fixed curses_bkgd() and
	  window_bkgd() to correctly return boolean result rather than numeric
	  result; fixed window_getbkgd() to correctly signal an error by
	  returning nil rather than -1.

	* ext/etc/etc.c: setup_passwd() and setup_group() now check for null
	  pointers before invoking rb_tainted_str_new2() upon fields extracted
	  from `struct passwd' and `struct group' since null pointers in some
	  fields are common on NextStep/OpenStep (especially so for the
	  `pw_comment' field) and rb_tainted_str_new2() throws an exception
	  when it receives a null pointer.

	* ext/pty/pty.c: include "util.h" for strdup()/ruby_strdup() for
	  platforms such as NextStep and OpenStep which lack strdup().

	* ext/socket/getaddrinfo.c: cast first argument of getservbyname(),
	  gethostbyaddr(), and gethostbyname() from (const char*) to non-const
	  (char*) for older platforms such as NextStep and OpenStep.

	* ext/socket/socket.c: include "util.h" for strdup()/ruby_strdup() for
	  platforms such as NextStep and OpenStep which lack strdup(); include
	  <netinet/in_systm.h> if present for NextStep and OpenStep; cast first
	  argument of gethostbyaddr() and getservbyname() from (const char*) to
	  non-const (char*) for older platforms.

	* ext/syslog/syslog.c: include "util.h" for strdup()/ruby_strdup() for
	  platforms such as NextStep and OpenStep which lack strdup().
