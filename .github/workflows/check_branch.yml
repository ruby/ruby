# We bidirectionally synchronize github.com/ruby/ruby.git's master branch and
# git.ruby-lang.org/ruby.git's master branch.
# We can use a pull request's merge button only on the master branch.
#
# Therefore, we require to pass this "check_branch" on all protected branches
# to prevent us from accidentally pushing commits to GitHub directly.
