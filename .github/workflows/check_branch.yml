# Protected branches:
#   * master: Synchronized between cgit and GitHub bidirectionally [experimental]
#   * other branches: Only writable from cgit.
#
# Thus this check is mandatory for "other branches" to prevent us from merging them,
# because these branches are not synchronized from GitHub to cgit at all.
