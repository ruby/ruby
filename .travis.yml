# Dependencies.  Some  header files are missing  in a Travis' worker  VM, so we
# have  to install  them.  The  "1.9.1" here  is OK.   It is  the  most adopted
# version string  for Debian/Ubuntu, and  no dependencies have been  changed so
# far since the 1.9.1 release.

# Script is where the test runs.  Note  we just do "make test", not other tests
