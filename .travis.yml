# Language specification.
language: c

# Compilers.  Several  compilers are  provided in Travis,  so we try  them all.
# The value set here is visible via $CC environment variable.
compiler:
  - gcc
  - clang

os:
  - linux
  - osx

# Dependencies.  Some  header files are missing  in a Travis' worker  VM, so we
# have  to install  them.  The  "1.9.1" here  is OK.   It is  the  most adopted
# version string  for Debian/Ubuntu, and  no dependencies have been  changed so
# far since the 1.9.1 release.

# Script is where the test runs.  Note  we just do "make test", not other tests
