# Language specification.
language: c

# Compilers.  Several  compilers are  provided in Travis,  so we try  them all.
# The value set here is visible via $CC environment variable.
compiler:
  - gcc
  - clang

# Dependencies.  Some  header files are missing  in a Travis' worker  VM, so we
# have  to install  them.  The  "1.9.1" here  is OK.   It is  the  most adopted
# version string  for Debian/Ubuntu, and  no dependencies have been  changed so
# far since the 1.9.1 release.
before_install:
  - "sudo apt-get -qq update"
  # Travis ships an outdated, broken version of libssl by default
  - "sudo apt-get -qq --only-upgrade install '^libssl.*'"
  - "sudo apt-get -qq install $CC" # upgrade if any
install: "sudo apt-get -qq build-dep ruby1.9.1 2>/dev/null"

# Script is where the test runs.  Note  we just do "make test", not other tests
# like  test-all, test-rubyspec.   This is  because  they take  too much  time,
# enough for Travis to shut down the VM as being stalled.
