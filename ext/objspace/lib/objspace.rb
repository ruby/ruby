  # _since_ must be a non-negative integer or +nil+.
  #
  # If _since_ is a positive integer, only objects of that generation and
  # newer generations are dumped. The current generation can be accessed using
  # GC::count. Objects that were allocated without object allocation tracing enabled
  # are ignored. See ::trace_object_allocations for more information and
  # examples.
  #
  # If _since_ is omitted or is +nil+, all objects are dumped.
  #
  # _shapes_ must be a boolean or a non-negative integer.

  # If _shapes_ is a positive integer, only shapes newer than the provided
  # shape id are dumped. The current shape_id can be accessed using <tt>RubyVM.stat(:next_shape_id)</tt>.
