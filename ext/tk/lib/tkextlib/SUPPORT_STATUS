  [ current support status of Tcl/Tk extensions ]

  *** RELEASE_DATE of the libraries => see 'tkextlib/version.rb' ***

The following list shows *CURRENT* status when this file was last modified.
If you want to add other Tcl/Tk extensions to the planned list (or change
their status position), please send a request to the ruby-talk,
ruby-list, or ruby-dev ML. Although we cannot promise to support your
requests, we'll try to do it.

If you want to check that wrapper libraries are ready to use on your
environment, please execute 'pkg_checker.rb' with no arguments. The
script may give you some hints about that.


  ***** IMPORTANT NOTE **********************************************

    'support' means that Ruby/Tk's wrapper libraries are released.
    'not support' does *NOT* mean that the extension doesn't work
    on Ruby/Tk.

    The version number of each extension means the latest version
    which is checked its feature. That is, it does NOT means only
    version of working. Library files maybe include some features
    which is included in the former version but removed from the
    latest, and maybe able to support the later version then the
    shown version.

    Even if the status of the extension is 'not support', you can
    control the functions/widgets of the extension without wrapper
    libraries by Tk.tk_call(), Tk.ip_eval(), and so on.

    If you cannot use installed Tcl/Tk extension, please check the
    followings.

     (1) On your Tcl/Tk, does the extension work?

     (2) Do DLL libraries of the extension exist on DLL load-path?
         (See also "<ruby archive>/ext/tcltklib/README.ActiveTcl")

     (3) Is the Tcl library directory of the extension included in
         library search-path of the Tcl interpreter linked Ruby/Tk?

    The check results may request you to do some setup operations
    before using the extension. If so, then please write the step
    of setup operations into the "setup.rb" file in the directory
    of the wrapper libraries for the extension (It is the wrapper
    libraries have the standard structure of the libraries in this
    directory). The "setup" file is required before requiring the
    Tcl library package (TkPackage.require(<libname>)).
