    /* Document-class: OpenSSL::PKCS5
     *
     * Provides password-based encryption functionality based on PKCS#5.
     * Typically used for securely deriving arbitrary length symmetric keys
     * to be used with an OpenSSL::Cipher from passwords. Another use case
     * is for storing passwords: Due to the ability to tweak the effort of
     * computation by increasing the iteration count, computation can be
     * slowed down artificially in order to render possible attacks infeasible.
     *
     * PKCS5 offers support for PBKDF2 with an OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1-based
     * HMAC, or an arbitrary Digest if the underlying version of OpenSSL
     * already supports it (>= 0.9.4).
     *
     * === Parameters
     * ==== Password
     * Typically an arbitrary String that represents the password to be used
     * for deriving a key.
     * ==== Salt
     * Prevents attacks based on dictionaries of common passwords. It is a
     * public value that can be safely stored along with the password (e.g.
     * if PBKDF2 is used for password storage). For maximum security, a fresh,
     * random salt should be generated for each stored password. According
     * to PKCS#5, a salt should be at least 8 bytes long.
     * ==== Iteration Count
     * Allows to tweak the length that the actual computation will take. The
     * larger the iteration count, the longer it will take.
     * ==== Key Length
     * Specifies the length in bytes of the output that will be generated.
     * Typically, the key length should be larger than or equal to the output
     * length of the underlying digest function, otherwise an attacker could
     * simply try to brute-force the key. According to PKCS#5, security is
     * limited by the output length of the underlying digest function, i.e.
     * security is not improved if a key length strictly larger than the
     * digest output length is chosen. Therefore, when using PKCS5 for
     * password storage, it suffices to store values equal to the digest
     * output length, nothing is gained by storing larger values.
     *
     * == Examples
     * === Generating a 128 bit key for a Cipher (e.g. AES)
     *   pass = "secret"
     *   salt = OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes(16)
     *   iter = 20000
     *   key_len = 16
     *   key = OpenSSL::PKCS5.pbkdf2_hmac_sha1(pass, salt, iter, key_len)
     *
     * === Storing Passwords
     *   pass = "secret"
     *   salt = OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes(16) #store this with the generated value
     *   iter = 20000
     *   digest = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256.new
     *   len = digest.digest_length
     *   #the final value to be stored
     *   value = OpenSSL::PKCS5.pbkdf2_hmac(pass, salt, iter, len, digest)
     *
     * === Important Note on Checking Passwords
     * When comparing passwords provided by the user with previously stored
     * values, a common mistake made is comparing the two values using "==".
     * Typically, "==" short-circuits on evaluation, and is therefore
     * vulnerable to timing attacks. The proper way is to use a method that
     * always takes the same amount of time when comparing two values, thus
     * not leaking any information to potential attackers. To compare two
     * values, the following could be used:
     *   def eql_time_cmp(a, b)
     *     unless a.length == b.length
     *       return false
     *     end
     *     cmp = b.bytes.to_a
     *     result = 0
     *     a.bytes.each_with_index {|c,i|
     *       result |= c ^ cmp[i]
     *     }
     *     result == 0
     *   end
     * Please note that the premature return in case of differing lengths
     * typically does not leak valuable information - when using PKCS#5, the
     * length of the values to be compared is of fixed size.
