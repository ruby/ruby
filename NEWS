=== Library updates (outstanding ones only)

* builtin classes

  * Array
    * added method:
      * added Array#bsearch for binary search.
    * incompatible changes:
      * random parameter of Array#shuffle! and Array#sample now
        will be called with one argument, maximum value.

  * Enumerable
    * added method:
      * added Enumerable#lazy method for lazy enumeration.

  * Enumerator
    * added method:
      * added Enumerator#size for lazy size evaluation.
    * extended method:
      * Enumerator.new accept an argument for lazy size evaluation.

  * ENV
    * aliased method:
      * ENV.to_h is a new alias for ENV.to_hash

  * File:
    * extended method:
      * File.fnmatch? now expands braces in the pattern if
        File::FNM_EXTGLOB option is given.

  * Hash
    * added method:
      * added Hash#to_h as explicit conversion method, like Array#to_a.
    * extended method:
      * Hash#default_proc= can be passed nil to clear the default proc.

  * Kernel
    * added method:
      * added Kernel#Hash conversion method like Array() or Float().
      * added Kernel#using, which imports refinements into the current scope.
        [experimental]
      * added Kernel#__dir__ which returns a current dirname.
    * extended method:
      * Kernel#warn accepts multiple args in like puts.
      * Kernel#caller accepts second optional argument `n' which specify
        required caller size.
      * Kernel#to_enum and enum_for accept a block for lazy size evaluation.
    * incompatible changes:
      * system() and exec() closes non-standard file descriptors
        (The default of :close_others option is changed to true by default.)
      * respond_to? against a protected method now returns false unless
        the second argument is true.
      * __callee__ has returned to the original behavior, and now
        returns the called name but not the original name in an
        aliased method.
      * Kernel#inspect does not call #to_s anymore
        (it used to call redefined #to_s).

  * LoadError
    * added method:
      * added LoadError#path method to return the file name that could not be
        loaded.

  * Module
    * added method:
      * added Module#prepend which is similar to Module#include,
        however a method in the prepended module overrides the
        corresponding method in the prepending module.
      * added Module#refine, which extends a class or module locally.
        [experimental]
      * added Module#refinements, which returns refinements defined in the
        receiver. [experimental]
      * added Module#using, which imports refinements into the receiver.
        [experimental]
    * extended method:
      * Module#define_method accepts a UnboundMethod from a Module.
      * Module#const_get accepts a qualified constant string, e.g.

    * added method:
      * added Class#singleton_instance returning the attached instance from a
        singleton Class. This is the reversed version of the
        Kernel#singleton_class getter method.

  * NilClass
    * added method:
      * added nil.to_h which returns {}

  * Range
    * added method:
      * added Range#size for lazy size evaluation.

        are specified.

  *String
    * added method:
      * added String#b returning a copied string whose encoding is ASCII-8BIT.

  * Struct
    * added method:
      * added Struct#to_h returning values with keys corresponding to the
        instance variable names.

  * Thread
    * added method:
      * added Thread#thread_variable_get for getting thread local variables
        (these are different than Fiber local variables).
      * added Thread#thread_variable_set for setting thread local variables.
      * added Thread#thread_variables for getting a list of the thread local
        variable keys.
      * added Thread#thread_variable? for testing to see if a particular thread
        variable has been set.

  * Time
    * change return value:
      * Time#to_s returned encoding defaults to US-ASCII but automatically
        transcodes to Encoding.default_internal if it is set.

  * Fiber
    * incompatible changes:
      * Fiber#resume cannot resume a fiber which invokes "Fiber#transfer".

  * GC::Profiler
    * added method:
      * added GC::Profiler.raw_data which returns raw profile data for GC.

  * toplevel
    * added method:
      * added main.define_method which defines a global function.

* net/http
  * new features:
    * Proxies are now automatically detected from the http_proxy environment
      variable.  See Net::HTTP::new for details.
    * gzip and deflate compression are now requested for all requests by
      default.  See Net::HTTP for details.
    * SSL sessions are now reused across connections for a single instance.
      This speeds up connection by using a previously negotiated session.
  * new methods:
    * Net::HTTP#local_host
    * Net::HTTP#local_host=
    * Net::HTTP#local_port
    * Net::HTTP#local_port=
  * extended method:
    * Net::HTTP#connect uses local_host and local_port if specified.

* net/imap
  * new methods:
    * Net::IMAP.default_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_imap_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_tls_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_ssl_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_imaps_port

* ostruct
  * new methods:
    * OpenStruct#[], []=
    * OpenStruct#each_pair
    * OpenStruct#eql?
    * OpenStruct#hash
    * OpenStruct#to_h converts the struct to a hash.
  * extended method:
    * OpenStruct.new also accepts an OpenStruct / Struct.

* pathname
  * extended method:
    * Pathname#find returns an enumerator if no block is given.

* rake
  * rake has been updated to version 0.9.4.

    This version is backwards-compatible with previous rake versions and
    contains many bug fixes.

    See
    http://rake.rubyforge.org/doc/release_notes/rake-0_9_4_rdoc.html for a list
    of changes in rake 0.9.3 and 0.9.4.

* resolv
  * new methods:
    * Resolv::DNS#timeouts=
    * Resolv::DNS::Config#timeouts=

* shellwords
    * Shellwords#shellescape() now stringifies the given object using to_s.
    * Shellwords#shelljoin() accepts non-string objects in the given
      array, each of which is stringified using to_s.

* syslog
  * Added Syslog::Logger which provides a Logger API atop Syslog.
  * Syslog::Priority, Syslog::Level, Syslog::Option and Syslog::Macros
    are introduced for easy detection of available constants on a
    running system.

* lib/tmpdir.rb
  * incompatible changes:
    * Dir.mktmpdir uses FileUtils.remove_entry instead of
      FileUtils.remove_entry_secure.  This means that applications should not
      change the permission of the created temporary directory to make
      accessible from other users.

* zlib
  * Added streaming support for Zlib::Inflate and Zlib::Deflate.  This allows
    processing of a stream without the use of large amounts of memory.
  * Added support for the new deflate strategies Zlib::RLE and Zlib::FIXED.
  * Zlib streams are now processed without the GVL.  This allows gzip, zlib and
    deflate streams to be processed in parallel.

* openssl
  * Consistently raise an error when trying to encode nil values. All instances
    of OpenSSL::ASN1::Primitive now raise TypeError when calling to_der on an
    instance whose value is nil. All instances of OpenSSL::ASN1::Constructive
    raise NoMethodError in the same case. Constructing such values is still
    permitted.
  * TLS 1.1 & 1.2 support by setting OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#ssl_version to
    :TLSv1_2, :TLSv1_2_server, :TLSv1_2_client or :TLSv1_1, :TLSv1_1_server
    :TLSv1_1_client. The version being effectively used can be queried
    with OpenSSL::SSL#ssl_version. Furthermore, it is also possible to
    blacklist the new TLS versions with OpenSSL::SSL:OP_NO_TLSv1_1 and
    OpenSSL::SSL::OP_NO_TLSv1_2.
  * Added OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#renegotiation_cb. A user-defined callback
    may be set which gets called whenever a new handshake is negotiated. This
    also allows to programmatically decline (client) renegotiation attempts.
  * Support for "0/n" splitting of records as BEAST mitigation via
    OpenSSL::SSL::OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS.
  * OpenSSL requires passwords for decrypting PEM-encoded files to be at least
    four characters long. This led to awkward situations where an export with
    a password with fewer than four characters was possible, but accessing the
    file afterwards failed. OpenSSL::PKey::RSA, OpenSSL::PKey::DSA and
    OpenSSL::PKey::EC therefore now enforce the same check when exporting a
    private key to PEM with a password - it has to be at least four characters
    long.
  * SSL/TLS support for the Next Protocol Negotiation extension. Supported
    with OpenSSL 1.0.1 and higher.
  * OpenSSL::OPENSSL_FIPS allows client applications to detect whether OpenSSL
    is running in FIPS mode and to react to the special requirements this
    might impy.

* yaml
  * Syck has been removed.  YAML now completely depends on libyaml being
    installed.

* objspace
  * new method:
    * ObjectSpace.reachable_objects_from(obj)

* rexml
  * REXML::Document#write supports Hash arguments.
  * REXML::Document#write supports new :encoding option. It changes
    XML document encoding. Without :encoding option, encoding in
    XML declaration is used for XML document encoding.

* cgi
  * Add HTML5 tag maker.
  * CGI#header has been renamed to CGI#http_header and
    aliased to CGI#header.
  * When HTML5 tagmaker called, overwrite CGI#header,
    CGI#header function is to create a <header> element.

=== Language changes

  * Added %i and %I for symbol list creation (similar to %w and %W).

  * Default source encoding is changed to UTF-8. (was US-ASCII)

=== Compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

  * Signal.trap

    See above.

  * Merge Onigmo.
    https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo

  * The :close_others option is true by default for system() and exec().
    Also, the close-on-exec flag is set by default for all new file descriptors.
    This means file descriptors doesn't inherit to spawned process unless
    explicitly requested such as system(..., fd=>fd).

  * Kernel#respond_to? against a protected method now returns false
    unless the second argument is true.

  * Dir.mktmpdir in lib/tmpdir.rb

    See above.

  * OpenStruct new methods can conflict with custom attributes named
    "each_pair", "eql?", "hash" or "to_h".
