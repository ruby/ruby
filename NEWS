  [Feature #8661] [experimental]

* Print error message in bold/underlined text if STDERR is unchanged and a tty.
  [Feature #14140] [experimental]

* configure option --with-ext now mandates its arguments.  So for
  instance if you run ./configure --with-ext=openssl,+ then the
  openssl library is guaranteed compiled, otherwise the build fails
  abnormally.

  Note however to always add the ",+" at the end of the argument.
  Otherwise nothing but openssl are built.  [Feature #13302]
