      * ARGF.print
      * ARGF.printf
      * ARGF.putc
      * ARGF.puts
      * ARGF.read_nonblock
      * ARGF.to_write_io
      * ARGF.write

  * Array
    * extended method:
      * Array#pack supports endian modifiers

  * Encoding
    * new encodings:
      * CP950
      * CP951
      * UTF-16
      * UTF-32
    * change alias:
      * SJIS is Windows-31J

  * File
    * new constant:
      * File::NULL
        name of NULL device.

  * IO
    * extended method:
      * IO#putc supports multibyte characters
    * new method:
      * IO#advise

  * Kernel
    * Kernel#respond_to? now returns false for protected methods.
    * move #__id__ to BasicObject.

  * Module
    * new methods:
      * Module#private_constant
      * Module#public_constant

  * String
    * extended method:
      * String#unpack supports endian modifiers

      * String#prepend
      * String#byteslice

  * Time

      * Time#strftime supports %:z and %::z.

  * Process
    * Process#maxgroups and Process#maxgroups= now raise NotImplementedError if
      the platform don't support supplementary groups concept.

  * PKey::RSA and PKey::DSA now use the generic X.509 encoding scheme 
    (e.g. used in a X.509 certificate's Subject Public Key Info) when
    exporting public keys to DER or PEM. Backward compatibility is 
    ensured by (already existing) fallbacks during creation.
  * OpenSSL::ASN1::Constructive#new and OpenSSL::ASN1::Primitive#new
    (and the constructors of their sub-classes) will no longer force
    tagging to be set to :EXPLICIT when tag and/or tag_class are passed
    as parameters. tagging must be set explicitly.
  * Support for infinite length encodings via infinite_length attribute.

* optparse
  * support for bash/zsh completion.

* RDoc
  * RDoc has been upgraded to RDoc 3.6.1.  For full release notes see
    http://docs.seattlerb.org/rdoc/History_txt.html

* rexml
  * [incompatible] support Ruby native encoding mechanism
    and iconv dependency is dropped. This means encoding
    methods (Document#encoding, XMLDecl#encoding,
    Output#encoding and Source#encoding) return an Encoding
    object instead of an encoding name.

  * New arguments:
    * -j N, --jobs=N: Allow run N testcases at once.
    * --jobs-status: Show status of jobs when parallel running.
    * --no-retry: Don't retry testcases which failed when parallel running.
    * --ruby=RUBY: path to ruby for job(worker) process. optional.

* FileUtils
  * extended method:
    * FileUtils#chmod supports symbolic mode argument.
