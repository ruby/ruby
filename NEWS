== Changes since the 2.2.0 release

=== Language changes

* frozen-string-literal pragma:

  * new pragma, frozen-string-literal has been experimentally introduced.
    [Feature #8976]
  * besides, --enable/--disable=frozen-string-literal options also have
    been introduced. [Feature #8976]
  * command line option --debug or --debug=frozen-string-literal enable
    additional debugging mode which shows created location with at frozen
    object error (RuntimeError) even if string is dynamically created string
    literal (for static string literals shows locations as default).
    [Feature #11725]

* safe navigation operator:

  * new method call syntax, `object&.foo', method #foo is called on
    `object' if it is not nil.
    this is similar to `try!' in Active Support, except:
    * method name is syntactically required
          obj.try! {} # valid
          obj&. {}    # syntax error
    * arguments are evaluated only if a call is made:
          obj.try!(:foo, bar())  # bar() is always evaluated
          obj&.foo(bar())        # bar() is conditionally evaluated
    * attribute assignment is valid
          obj&.attr += 1
    [Feature #11537]

* indented here document:

  * new string literal, here document starts with `<<~`.
    refer doc/syntax/literals.rdoc for more details.
    [Feature #9098]

  * Array#bsearch_index [Feature #10730]
  * Array#dig [Feature #11643]

  * Enumerable#grep_v is added as inverse version of Enumerable#grep.
    [Feature #11049]
  * Enumerable#chunk_while [Feature #10769]

* Enumerator::Lazy

  * Enumerator::Lazy#grep_v [Feature #11773]

    this flag means to permit deleting opened file on Windows, but currently
    this affect only files opened as binary.  [Feature #11218]

  * new option parameter `flags' is added.
    this parameter is bitwise-ORed to oflags generated by normal mode argument.
    [Feature #11253]

* Kernel

  * Kernel#loop, when stopped by a StopIteration exception, returns
    what the enumerator has returned instead of nil. [Feature #11498]

  * Queue#close is added to notice a termination. [Feature #10600]

* Regexp/String: Updated Unicode version from 7.0.0 to 8.0.0

* RubyVM::InstructionSequence
  * add the following methods as a primitive tool of iseq loader.
    See sample/iseq_loader.rb for usage.
    Note that loader does not have verifier so it is easy to cause
    critical problem by loading modified/broken binary data.
    See [Feature #11788] for more details. (experimental feature)
    * RubyVM::InstructionSequence#to_binary_format(extra_data = nil)

  * Array#select!, Array#keep_if, Array#reject!, and Array#delete_if
    no longer changes the receiver array instantly every time the
    block is called.  [Feature #10714]

  * On Windows File::Stat#ino always returned 0, but now returns
    BY_HANDLE_FILE_INFORMATION.nFileIndexHigh/Low.

* IO
  * IO#close doesn't raise when the IO object is closed.  [Feature #10718]
  * IO#each_codepoint raises an exception at incomplete character
    before EOF when conversion takes place.  [Bug #11444]

* Module
  * Module#define_method and Object.define_singleton_method now
    require method body, Proc, Method, or a block, and raise
    ArgumentError if no block is given directly.  [Bug #11283]

    :wait_readable or :wait_writable symbols instead of raising
    IO::WaitReadable or IO::WaitWritable exceptions

    [Feature #11052]

* io/wait
  * IO#wait_readable no longer checks FIONREAD, it may be used for
