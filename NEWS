with all sufficient information, see the ChangeLog file.

== Changes since the 1.9.3 release

=== C API updates
* NUM2SHORT() and NUM2USHORT() added. They are similar to NUM2INT, but short.

=== Library updates (outstanding ones only)

* builtin classes

  * Enumerable
    * added method:
      * added Enumerable#lazy method for lazy enumeration.

  * ENV
    * aliased method:
      * ENV.to_h is a new alias for ENV.to_hash

  * Hash
    * added method:
      * added Hash#to_h as explicit conversion method, like Array#to_a.
    * extended method:
      * Hash#default_proc= can be passed nil to clear the default proc.

  * Kernel
    * added method:
      * added Kernel#Hash conversion method like Array() or Float().
    * extended method:
      * Kernel#warn accepts multiple args in like puts.
      * Kernel#caller accepts second optional argument `n' which specify
        required caller size.
    * incompatible changes:
      * system() and exec() closes non-standard file descriptors
        (The default of :close_others option is changed to true by default.)
      * respond_to? against a protected method now returns false unless
        the second argument is true.

  * LoadError
    * added method:
      * added LoadError#path method to return the file name that could not be
        loaded.

  * NilClass
    * added method:
      * added nil.to_h which returns {}

  * Signal
    * incompatible changes:
      * Signal.trap raises ArgumentError when :SEGV, :BUS, :ILL, :FPE, :VTALRM
        are specified.

  * Struct
    * added method:
      * added Struct#to_h returning values with keys corresponding to the
        instance variable names.

  * Time
    * change return value:
      * Time#to_s returned encoding defaults to US-ASCII but automatically
        transcodes to Encoding.default_internal if it is set.

  * Fiber
    * incompatible changes:
      * Fiber#resume cannot resume a fiber which invokes "Fiber#transfer".

* net/imap
  * new methods:
    * Net::IMAP.default_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_imap_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_tls_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_ssl_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_imaps_port

* ostruct
  * new methods:
    * OpenStruct#to_h converts the struct to a hash.

* pathname
  * extended method:
    * Pathname#find returns an enumerator if no block is given.

* resolv
  * new methods:
    * Resolv::DNS#timeouts=
    * Resolv::DNS::Config#timeouts=

* shellwords
    * Shellwords#shellescape() now stringifies the given object using to_s.
    * Shellwords#shelljoin() accepts non-string objects in the given
      array, each of which is stringified using to_s.

* syslog
  * Added Syslog::Logger which provides a Logger API atop Syslog.
  * Syslog::Priority, Syslog::Level, Syslog::Option and Syslog::Macros
    are introduced for easy detection of available constants on a
    running system.

* lib/tmpdir.rb
  * incompatible changes:
    * Dir.mktmpdir uses FileUtils.remove_entry instead of
      FileUtils.remove_entry_secure.  This means that applications should not
      change the permission of the created temporary directory to make
      accessible from other users.

* zlib
  * Added support for the new deflate strategies Zlib::RLE and Zlib::FIXED.

* openssl
  * Consistently raise an error when trying to encode nil values. All instances
    of OpenSSL::ASN1::Primitive now raise TypeError when calling to_der on an
    instance whose value is nil. All instances of OpenSSL::ASN1::Constructive
    raise NoMethodError in the same case. Constructing such values is still
    permitted.

=== Language changes
=== Compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

  * Signal.trap

    See above.

  * Merge Onigmo.

  * The :close_others option is true by default for system() and exec().
    Also, the close-on-exec flag is set by default for all new file descriptors.
    This means file descriptors doesn't inherit to spawned process unless
    explicitly requested such as system(..., fd=>fd).

  * Kernel#respond_to? against a protected method now returns false
    unless the second argument is true.

  * Dir.mktmpdir in lib/tmpdir.rb

    See above.
