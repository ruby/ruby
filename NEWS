== Changes since the 2.5.0 release

=== Language changes

* <code>$SAFE</code> is a process global state and we can set 0 again. [Feature #14250]

* refinements takes place at block passing.  [Feature #14223]

* refinements takes place at Kernel#public_send.  [Feature #15326]

* refinements takes place at Kernel#respond_to?.  [Feature #15327]

* +else+ without +rescue+ now causes a syntax error.  [EXPERIMENTAL] [Feature #14606]

* constant names may start with a non-ASCII capital letter. [Feature #13770]

* An endless range is introduced.  You can write a range that has no end,
  like <code>(0..)</code>.  The following shows typical use cases.  [Feature #12912]

    ary[1..]                            # identical to ary[1..-1]
    (1..).each {|index| ... }           # infinite loop from index 1
    ary.zip(1..) {|elem, index| ... }   # ary.each.with_index(1) { }

* Non-Symbol key in keyword arguments hash causes an exception.

* "shadowing outer local variable" warning was removed.  [Feature #12490]
  You can now write the following without warning.

    user = users.find {|user| cond(user) }

* Print exception backtrace and error message in reverse order when the
  exception is not caught and STDOUT is unchanged and a tty. [Feature #8661]

* Print +cause+ of the exception if the exception is not caught and printed
  its backtraces and error message [Feature #8257]

* Flip-flop syntax is deprecated. [Feature #5400]

* Native implementations (arm32, arm64, ppc64le, win32, win64, x86, amd64) of
  coroutines to improve performance of Fiber. [Feature #14739]

=== Core classes updates (outstanding ones only)

[Array]

  [New methods]

    * Added Array#union and Array#difference instance methods.  [Feature #14097]

  [Modified methods]

    * Array#to_h now maps elements to new keys and values by the
      block if given.  [Feature #15143]

  [Aliased methods]

    * Array#filter is a new alias for Array#select. [Feature #13784]
    * Array#filter! is a new alias for Array#select!. [Feature #13784]

[Binding]

  [New methods]

    * added Binding#source_location.  [Feature #14230]

      This method returns the source location of the binding, a 2-element
      array of <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__LINE__</code>.
      Traditionally, the same information could be retrieved by
      <code>eval("[__FILE__, __LINE__]", binding)</code>, but we are
      planning to change this behavior so that Kernel#eval ignores
      binding's source location [Bug #4352].  So, users should use this
      newly-introduced method instead of Kernel#eval.

=== Stdlib updates (outstanding ones only)

[BigDecimal]

  Update to the version 1.4.0.  This version includes several compatibility
  issues, see Compatibility issues section below for the detail.

  [Modified methods]

  * BigDecimal() accepts new keywords "exception:" likewise Float().

[Bundler]

  * Add Bundler to Standard Library. [Feature #12733]

  * Use 1.17.2. It's the latest stable version.

[Coverage]

  A oneshot_lines mode is added.  [Feature #15022]
  This mode checks "whether each line was executed at least once or not",
  instead of "how many times each line was executed".
  A hook for each line is fired at most once, and after it is fired
  the hook flag is removed, i.e., it runs with zero overhead.

  [New options]

    * Add +:oneshot_lines+ keyword argument to Coverage.start.

    * Add +:stop+ and +:clear+ keyword arguments to Coverage.result.
      If +clear+ is true, it clears the counters to zero.
      If +stop+ is true, it disables coverage measurement.

  [New methods]

    * Coverage.line_stub, which is a simple helper function that
      creates the "stub" of line coverage from a given source code.

[ERB]

  [New options]

    * Add +:trim_mode+ and +:eoutvar+ keyword arguments to ERB.new.
      Now non-keyword arguments other than first one are softly deprecated
      and will be removed when Ruby 2.5 becomes EOL. [Feature #14256]

    * erb command's <tt>-S</tt> option is deprecated, which will be removed
      in the next version.

      whose name is misleading.  [Bug #14688]

[REXML]

  [Improved some XPath implementations]

    * <code>concat()</code> function: Stringify all arguments before concatenating

    * <code>string()</code> function: Support context node

    * <code>string()</code> function: Support processing instruction node

    * Support <code>"*:#{ELEMENT_NAME}"</code> syntax in XPath 2.0

  [Fixed some XPath implementations]

    * <code>"//#{ELEMENT_NAME}[#{POSITION}]"</code> case

    * <code>string()</code> function: Fix <code>function(document)</code>
      returns nodes that are out of root elements.

    * <code>"/ #{ELEMENT_NAME} "</code> case

    * <code>"/ #{ELEMENT_NAME} [ #{PREDICATE} ]"</code> case

    * <code>"/ #{AXIS}::#{ELEMENT_NAME}"</code> case

    * <code>"#{N}-#{M}"</code> case: One or more white spaces were required
      before <code>"-"</code>

    and is now warned.  [Feature #14643]

[File]

  * File.read, File.binread, File.write, File.binwrite, File.foreach, and
    File.readlines do not invoke external commands even if the path starts
    with the pipe character <code>'|'</code>. [Feature #14245]

[Object]

  * Object#=~ is deprecated.  [Feature #15231]

=== Stdlib compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

* These standard libraries have been promoted to default gems.

  * forwardable
  * irb
  * logger
  * matrix
  * mutex_m
  * ostruct
  * prime
  * rexml
  * rss
  * shell
  * sync
  * thwait
  * tracer

[BigDecimal]

  * The following methods are removed.

    * BigDecimal.allocate
    * BigDecimal.new
    * BigDecimal.ver

  * Every BigDecimal object is frozen. [Feature #13984]

  * BigDecimal() parses the given string like Float().

  * String#to_d parses the receiver string like String#to_f.

=== C API updates

=== Implementation improvements

* Speedup Proc#call because we don't need to care about <code>$SAFE</code>
  any more. [Feature #14318]

  With +lc_fizzbuzz+ benchmark which uses so many Proc#call we can
  measure x1.4 improvements.  [Bug #10212]

* Speedup block.call where +block+ is passed block parameter. [Feature #14330]

  Ruby 2.5 improves block passing performance. [Feature #14045]

  Additionally, Ruby 2.6 improves the performance of passed block calling.

* Introduce an initial implementation of JIT (Just-in-time) compiler. [Feature #14235] [experimental]

  * <tt>--jit</tt> command line option is added to enable JIT. <tt>--jit-verbose=1</tt>
    is good for inspection.  See <tt>ruby --help</tt> for others.
  * To generate machine code, this JIT compiler uses C compiler used for building
    the interpreter. Currently GCC, Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++ are supported for it.
  * <tt>--disable-mjit-support</tt> option is added to configure. This is added for JIT debugging,
    but if you get an error on building a header file for JIT, you can use this option to skip
    building it as a workaround.
  * rb_waitpid reimplemented on Unix-like platforms to maintain
    compatibility with processes created for JIT [Bug #14867]

* VM generator script renewal; makes the generated VM more optimized. [GH-1779]

* Thread cache enabled for pthreads platforms (for Thread.new and
  Thread.start).  [Feature #14757]

* timer thread is eliminated for platforms with POSIX timers [Misc #14937]

* Transient Heap (theap) is supported. [Bug #14858] [Feature #14989]
  theap is managed heap for short-living memory objects. For example,
  making small and short-living Hash object is x2 faster. With rdoc benchmark,
  we measured 6-7% performance improvement.

=== Miscellaneous changes

* On macOS, shared libraries no longer include a full version number of Ruby
  in their names.  This eliminates the burden of each teeny upgrade on the
  platform that users need to rebuild every extension library.
