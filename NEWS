= NEWS for Ruby 2.3.0

This document is a list of user visible feature changes made between
releases except for bug fixes.

Note that each entry is kept so brief that no reason behind or
reference information is supplied with.  For a full list of changes
with all sufficient information, see the ChangeLog file.

== Changes since the 2.2.0 release

=== Language changes

* frozen-string-literal pragma:
  * new pragma, frozen-string-literal has been experimentally introduced.
  * besides, --enable/--disable=frozen-string-literal options also have
    been introduced.

* safe navigation operator:

  * new method call syntax, `object&.foo', method #foo is called on
    `object' if it is not nil.
    this is similar to `try!' in Active Support, except:
    * method name is syntactically required
          obj.try! {} # valid
          obj&. {}    # syntax error
    * arguments are evaluated only if a call is made:
          obj.try!(:foo, bar())  # bar() is always evaluated
          obj&.foo(bar())        # bar() is conditionally evaluated
    * attribute assignment is valid
          obj&.attr += 1

    true when the receiver is positive and negative respectively.
    [Feature #11151]

* Proc

  * Proc#call (and also #[], #===, #yield) are optimized.
    Backtrace doesn't show each method (show block lines directly).
    TracePoint also ignores these calls. [Feature #11569]

    method on elements beyond the given level.  [Bug #10748]

  * On Windows File::Stat#ino always returned 0, but now returns
    BY_HANDLE_FILE_INFORMATION.nFileIndexHigh/Low.

  * IO#close doesn't raise when the IO object is closed.  [Feature #10718]
  * IO#each_codepoint raises an exception at incomplete character
    before EOF when conversion takes place.  [Bug #11444]

    BasicSocket#recv_nonblock, BasicSocket#recvmsg_nonblock,
    BasicSocket#sendmsg_nonblock all support `exception: false` to return
    :wait_readable or :wait_writable symbols instead of raising
    IO::WaitReadable or IO::WaitWritable exceptions
  * BasicSocket#recv and BasicSocket#recv_nonblock allow an output
    String buffer argument like IO#read and IO#read_nonblock to reduce
    GC overhead

    [Feature #11052]

* lib/matrix.rb
 * Add Vector#round. https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/802

* ext/coverage/coverage.c
  * Coverage.peek_result: new method to allow coverage to be captured without
    stopping the coverage tool.

* Net::HTTP
  * default value of Net::HTTP#open_timeout is now 60 (was nil).

* Net::Telnet
  * Net::Telnet is extracted to net-telnet gem. It's unmaintain code.
