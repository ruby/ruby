= NEWS for Ruby 2.6.0

This document is a list of user visible feature changes made between
releases except for bug fixes.

Note that each entry is kept so brief that no reason behind or

== Changes since the 2.5.0 release

=== Language changes

* $SAFE is a process global state and we can set 0 again. [Feature #14250]

* refinements take place at block passing.  [Feature #14223]

=== Core classes updates (outstanding ones only)

* Binding

  * New methods:

    * added Binding#source_location.  [Feature #14230]

      This method returns the source location of binding, a 2-element
      array of `__FILE__` and `__LINE__`.  Traditionally, the same
      information could be retrieved by `eval("[__FILE__, __LINE__]",
      binding)`, but we are planning to change this behavior so that
      `Kernel#eval` ignores binding's source location [Bug #4352].
      So, users should use this newly-introduced method instead of
      `Kernel#eval`.

* Dir

  * New methods:

    * added Dir#each_child and Dir#children instance methods.
      [Feature #13969]

* Kernel

  * Kernel.#system takes :exception option to raise an exception on
    failure. [Feature #14386]

* KeyError

  * KeyError#initialize accepts :receiver and :key options to set receiver and key in Ruby code. [Feature #14313]

* NameError

  * NameError#initialize accepts :receiver option to set receiver in Ruby code. [Feature #14313]

* NoMethodError

  * NoMethodError#initialize accepts :receiver option to set receiver in Ruby code. [Feature #14313]

* Proc

  * Proc#call doesn't change $SAFE any more. [Feature #14250]

* Random

  * New methods:

    * added Random.bytes. [Feature #4938]

=== Stdlib updates (outstanding ones only)

* Matrix

  * New method:

    * Matrix#antisymmetric?

=== Compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

=== Stdlib compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

=== C API updates

=== Supported platform changes

=== Implementation improvements

* Speedup `Proc#call` because we don't need to care about `$SAFE` any more.
  [Feature #14318]
  With `lc_fizzbuzz` benchmark which uses so many `Proc#call` we can measure
  x1.4 improvements [Bug #10212].

* Speedup `block.call` where `block` is passed block parameter. [Feature #14330]
  Ruby 2.5 improves block passing performance. [Feature #14045]
  Additionally, Ruby 2.6 improves the performance of passed block calling.

* `--jit` option to enable JIT compiler is added. [Feature #14235] [experimental]

* VM generator script renewal; makes the generated VM more optimized. [GH-1779]
