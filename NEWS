== Changes since the 2.6.0 release

=== Language changes

* Pattern matching is introduced as an experimental feature. [Feature #14912]

* Method reference operator, <code>.:</code> is introduced as an
  experimental feature.  [Feature #12125] [Feature #13581]

* Proc.new and proc with no block in a method called with a block is warned
  now.

* lambda with no block in a method called with a block errs.

* Non-Symbol keys in a keyword arguments hash were prohibited in 2.6.0,
  but are now allowed again.  [Bug #15658]

* Numbered parameter as the default block parameter is introduced as an
  experimental feature.  [Feature #4475]

* A beginless range is experimentally introduced.  It might not be as useful
  as an endless range, but would be good for DSL purpose.  [Feature #14799]

     ary[..3]  # identical to ary[0..3]
     where(sales: ..100)

* Setting <code>$;</code> to non-nil value is warned now.  Use of it in
  String#split is warned too.

* Setting <code>$,</code> to non-nil value is warned now.  Use of it in
  Array#join is warned too.

* Quoted here-document identifier must end within the same line.

     <<"EOS
     " # This has been warned since 2.4
     EOS

* Pipeline operator is experimentally added.

  This code equals to the next code.

     foo()
      |> bar 1, 2
      |> display

     foo()
      .bar(1, 2)
      .display

* The flip-flop syntax deprecation is reverted. [Feature #5400]

=== Core classes updates (outstanding ones only)

Complex::

  New method::

    * Added Complex#<=>. So 0 <=> 0i will not raise NoMethodError.
      [Bug #15857]

Encoding::

  * Added new encoding CESU-8 [Feature #15931]

Enumerable::

  New methods::

    * Added Enumerable#filter_map.  [Feature #15323]

    * Added Enumerable#tally.  [Feature #11076]

Enumerator::

  New method::

    * Added Enumerator::Yielder#to_proc so that a Yielder object
      can be directly passed to another method as a block
      argument.  [Feature #15618]

FrozenError::

  New method::

    * Added FrozenError#receiver to return the frozen object that
      modification was attempted on.  To set this object when raising
      FrozenError in Ruby code, pass it as the second argument to
      FrozenError.new.

GC::

  New method::

    * Added GC.compact method for compacting the heap.
      This function compacts live objects in the heap so that fewer pages may
      be used, and the heap may be more CoW friendly. [Feature #15626]

      Details on the algorithm and caveats can be found here:
      https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15626

IO::

  New method::

      encoding.  [Bug #15210]

Integer::

  Modified method::

    * Integer#[] now supports range operation.  [Feature #8842]

         0b01001101[2, 4]  #=> 0b0011
         0b01001100[2..5]  #=> 0b0011
         0b01001100[2...6] #=> 0b0011
             ^^^^

Module::

  New method::

    * Added Module#const_source_location to retrieve the location where a
      constant is defined.  [Feature #10771]

  Removed method::

    * RubyVM.resolve_feature_path moved to
      $LOAD_PATH.resolve_feature_path.  [Feature #15903] [Feature #15230]

  New methods::

    * Added Time#ceil method.  [Feature #15772]

    * Added Time#floor method.  [Feature #15653]

=== Stdlib updates (outstanding ones only)

Bundler::

  * Upgrade to Bundler 2.1.0.pre.1
    Bundled from https://github.com/bundler/bundler/commit/a53709556b95a914e874b22ed2116a46b0528852

CGI::

  * CGI.escapeHTML becomes 2~5x faster when there's at least one escaped character.

CSV::

  * Upgrade to 3.0.9.
    See https://github.com/ruby/csv/blob/master/NEWS.md.

Date::

  * Date.jisx0301, Date#jisx0301, and Date.parse support the new Japanese
    era.  [Feature #15742]

Delegator::

  * Object#DelegateClass accepts a block and module_evals it in the context
    of the returned class, similar to Class.new and Struct.new.

ERB::

  * Prohibit marshaling ERB instance.

IRB::

  * Introduce syntax highlight inspired by pry.gem to Binding#irb source lines,
    REPL input, and inspect output of some core-class objects.

  * Introduce multiline mode by Reline.

  * Show documents when completion.

  * Enable auto indent and save/load history by default.

Net::IMAP::

  * Add Server Name Indication (SNI) support.  [Feature #15594]

open-uri::

  * Warn open-uri's "open" method at Kernel.
    Use URI.open instead.  [Misc #15893]

  * The default charset of text/* media type is UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1.
    [Bug #15933]

Pathname::

  * Delegates 3 arguments from Pathname.glob to Dir.glob to
    accept base: keyword.

Racc::

  * Merge 1.4.15 from upstream repository and added cli of racc.

Reline::

  * New stdlib that is compatible with readline stdlib by pure Ruby and also
    has a multiline mode.

RSS::

  * Upgrade to RSS 0.2.8.
    See https://github.com/ruby/rss/blob/master/NEWS.md.

RubyGems::

  * Upgrade to RubyGems 3.1.0.pre1
    Bundled from https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/97b264f0fa248c864b6ee9a23d3ff1cdd217dddb

=== Compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

=== Stdlib compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

profile.rb, Profiler__::

  * Removed from standard library. No one maintains it from Ruby 2.0.0.

=== C API updates

=== Implementation improvements

Fiber::

  * Allow selecting different coroutine implementation by using
    `--with-coroutine=`, e.g.

         ./confgure --with-coroutine=ucontext
         ./confgure --with-coroutine=copy

  * Replace previous stack cache with fiber pool cache. The fiber pool
    allocates many stacks in a single memory region. Stack allocation
    becomes O(log N) and fiber creation is amortized O(1). Around 10x
    performance improvement was measured in micro-benchmarks.

Thread::

  * VM stack memory allocation is now combined with native thread stack,
    improving thread allocation performance and reducing allocation related
    failures. ~10x performance improvement was measured in micro-benchmarks.

JIT::

  * JIT-ed code is recompiled to less-optimized code when an optimization assumption is invalidated.

  * Method inlining is performed when a method is considered as pure.
    This optimization is still experimental and many methods are NOT considered as pure yet.

  * Default value of +--jit-max-cache+ is changed from 1,000 to 100

  * Default value of +--jit-min-calls+ is changed from 5 to 10,000

=== Miscellaneous changes

* Support for IA64 architecture has been removed. Hardware for testing was
  difficult to find, native fiber code is difficult to implement, and it added
  non-trivial complexity to the interpreter. [Feature #15894]

* Require compilers to support C99 [Misc #15347]

  * Details of our dialect: https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/wiki/C99

* Ruby's upstream repository is changed from Subversion to Git.

  * https://git.ruby-lang.org/ruby.git

  * RUBY_REVISION class is changed from Integer to String.

  * RUBY_DESCRIPTION includes Git revision instead of Subversion's one.
