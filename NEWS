=== Compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

=== Stdlib compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

profile.rb, Profiler__::

  * Removed from standard library. No one maintains it from Ruby 2.0.0.

=== C API updates

=== Implementation improvements

JIT::

  * JIT-ed code is recompiled to less-optimized code when an optimization assumption is invalidated.

  * Method inlining is performed when a method is considered as pure.
    This optimization is still experimental and many methods are NOT considered as pure yet.

  * Default value of +--jit-min-calls+ is changed from 5 to 10,000

GC::

  * New `GC.compact` method for compacting the heap.
    This function compacts live objects in the heap so that fewer pages may
    be used, and the heap may be more CoW friendly. [Feature #15626]

    Details on the algorithm and caveats can be found here:
    https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15626
