=== Compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

* Random.raw_seed renamed to become Random.urandom.  It is now

=== Stdlib compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

* mathn.rb
  Removed from stdlib. [Feature #10169]

* (This might not be a "user visible feature change" but) Hash class's
  hash function is now SipHash13. [Feature #13017]

* SecureRandom now prefers OS-provided sources than OpenSSL. [Bug #9569]

=== Miscellaneous changes

* configure option --with-ext now mandates its arguments.  So for
  instance if you run ./configure --with-ext=openssl,+ then the
  openssl library is guaranteed compiled, otherwise the build fails
  abnormally.

  Note however to always add the ",+" at the end of the argument.
  Otherwise nothing but openssl are built.  [Feature #13302]
