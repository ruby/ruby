= Native Client port of Ruby

= How to build
== Prerequisites
You need to install the following things before building NaCl port of Ruby.
* Ruby 1.9.3 or later
* Python 2.6 or later
* NativeClient SDK pepper 22 or later
* GNU make

== Steps
(1) Extract all files from the tarball:
     $ tar xzf ruby-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
(2) Set NACL_SDK_ROOT environment vairanble to the path to the Native Client SDK you installed:
     $ export NACL_SDK_ROOT=/home/yugui/src/nacl_sdk/pepper_16
(3) Configure
     $ ./configure --prefix=/tmp/nacl-ruby --host=x86_64-nacl --with-baseruby=/path/to/ruby-1.9.3
(4) Make
     $ make
     $ make package

Now you have ruby.nexe. You can run it by sel_ldr in NaCl SDK.

"make package" installs "pepper-ruby.nexe", an example Pepper application that
embeds Ruby", and libraries to $prefix. You can run it by the following steps:
(5) Publish the $prefix directory on a web server
(6) Visit the example.html on the web server by a browser that implements Pepper 18 or later.
