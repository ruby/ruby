# = open3.rb: Popen, but with stderr, too
#
# Author:: Yukihiro Matsumoto
# Documentation:: Konrad Meyer
#
# Open3 gives you access to stdin, stdout, and stderr when running other
# programs.
#

#
# Open3 grants you access to stdin, stdout, stderr and a thread to wait for the
# child process when running another program.
# You can specify various attributes, redirections, current directory, etc., of
# the program in the same way as for Process.spawn.
#
# - Open3.popen3 : pipes for stdin, stdout, stderr
# - Open3.popen2 : pipes for stdin, stdout
# - Open3.popen2e : pipes for stdin, merged stdout and stderr
# - Open3.capture3 : give a string for stdin; get strings for stdout, stderr
# - Open3.capture2 : give a string for stdin; get a string for stdout
# - Open3.capture2e : give a string for stdin; get a string for merged stdout and stderr
# - Open3.pipeline_rw : pipes for first stdin and last stdout of a pipeline
# - Open3.pipeline_r : pipe for last stdout of a pipeline
# - Open3.pipeline_w : pipe for first stdin of a pipeline
# - Open3.pipeline_start : run a pipeline without waiting
# - Open3.pipeline : run a pipeline and wait for its completion
#

module Open3

  # Open stdin, stdout, and stderr streams and start external executable.
  # In addition, a thread to wait for the started process is created.
  # The thread has a pid method and a thread variable :pid which is the pid of
  # the started process.
  #
  # Block form:
  #
  #   Open3.popen3([env,] cmd... [, opts]) {|stdin, stdout, stderr, wait_thr|
  #     pid = wait_thr.pid # pid of the started process.
  #     ...
  #     exit_status = wait_thr.value # Process::Status object returned.
  #   }
  #
  # Non-block form:
  #
  #   stdin, stdout, stderr, wait_thr = Open3.popen3([env,] cmd... [, opts])
  #   pid = wait_thr[:pid]  # pid of the started process
  #   ...
  #   stdin.close  # stdin, stdout and stderr should be closed explicitly in this form.
  #   stdout.close
  #   stderr.close
  #   exit_status = wait_thr.value  # Process::Status object returned.
  #
  # The parameters env, cmd, and opts are passed to Process.spawn.
  # A commandline string and a list of argument strings can be accepted as follows:
  #
  #   Open3.popen3("echo abc") {|i, o, e, t| ... }
  #   Open3.popen3("echo", "abc") {|i, o, e, t| ... }
  #   Open3.popen3(["echo", "argv0"], "abc") {|i, o, e, t| ... }
  #
  # If the last parameter, opts, is a Hash, it is recognized as an option for Process.spawn.
  #
  #   Open3.popen3("pwd", :chdir=>"/") {|i,o,e,t|
  #     p o.read.chomp #=> "/"
  #   }
  #
  # wait_thr.value waits for the termination of the process.
  # The block form also waits for the process when it returns.
  #
  # Closing stdin, stdout and stderr does not wait for the process to complete.
  #
  # You should be careful to avoid deadlocks.
  # Since pipes are fixed length buffers,
  # Open3.popen3("prog") {|i, o, e, t| o.read } deadlocks if
  # the program generates too much output on stderr.
  # You should read stdout and stderr simultaneously (using threads or IO.select).
  # However, if you don't need stderr output, you can use Open3.popen2.
  # If merged stdout and stderr output is not a problem, you can use Open3.popen2e.
  # If you really need stdout and stderr output as separate strings, you can consider Open3.capture3.
