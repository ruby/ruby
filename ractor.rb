# Ractor is a Actor-model abstraction for Ruby that provides thread-safe parallel execution.
#
# Ractor.new can make a new Ractor, and it will run in parallel.
#
#     # The simplest ractor
#     r = Ractor.new {puts "I am in Ractor!"}
#     r.take # wait for it to finish
#     # here "I am in Ractor!" would be printed
#
# Ractors do not share usual objects, so the same kinds of thread-safety concerns such as data-race,
# race-conditions are not available on multi-ractor programming.
#
# To achieve this, ractors severely limit object sharing between different ractors.
# For example, unlike threads, ractors can't access each other's objects, nor any objects through
# variables of the outer scope.
#
#     a = 1
#     r = Ractor.new {puts "I am in Ractor! a=#{a}"}
#     # fails immediately with
#     # ArgumentError (can not isolate a Proc because it accesses outer variables (a).)
#
# On CRuby (the default implementation), Global Virtual Machine Lock (GVL) is held per ractor, so
# ractors are performed in parallel without locking each other.
#
# Instead of accessing the shared state, the objects should be passed to and from ractors via
# sending and receiving objects as messages.
#
#     a = 1
#     r = Ractor.new do
#       a_in_ractor = receive # receive blocks till somebody will pass message
#       puts "I am in Ractor! a=#{a_in_ractor}"
#     end
#     r.send(a)  # pass it
#     r.take
#     # here "I am in Ractor! a=1" would be printed
#
# There are two pairs of methods for sending/receiving messages:
#
# * Ractor#send and Ractor.receive for when the _sender_ knows the receiver (push);
# * Ractor.yield and Ractor#take for when the _receiver_ knows the sender (pull);
#
# In addition to that, an argument to Ractor.new would be passed to block and available there
# as if received by Ractor.receive, and the last block value would be sent outside of the
# ractor as if sent by Ractor.yield.
#
# A little demonstration on a classic ping-pong:
#
#     server = Ractor.new do
#       puts "Server starts: #{self.inspect}"
#       puts "Server sends: ping"
#       Ractor.yield 'ping'                       # The server doesn't know the receiver and sends to whoever interested
#       received = Ractor.receive                 # The server doesn't know the sender and receives from whoever sent
#       puts "Server received: #{received}"
#     end
#
#     client = Ractor.new(server) do |srv|        # The server is sent inside client, and available as srv
#       puts "Client starts: #{self.inspect}"
#       received = srv.take                       # The Client takes a message specifically from the server
#       puts "Client received from " \
#            "#{srv.inspect}: #{received}"
#       puts "Client sends to " \
#            "#{srv.inspect}: pong"
#       srv.send 'pong'                           # The client sends a message specifically to the server
#     end
#
#     [client, server].each(&:take)               # Wait till they both finish
#
# This will output:
#
#     Server starts: #<Ractor:#2 test.rb:1 running>
#     Server sends: ping
#     Client starts: #<Ractor:#3 test.rb:8 running>
#     Client received from #<Ractor:#2 rac.rb:1 blocking>: ping
#     Client sends to #<Ractor:#2 rac.rb:1 blocking>: pong
#     Server received: pong
#
# It is said that Ractor receives messages via the <em>incoming port</em>, and sends them
# to the <em>outgoing port</em>. Either one can be disabled with Ractor#close_incoming and
# Ractor#close_outgoing respectively. If a ractor terminated, its ports will be closed
# automatically.
#
# == Shareable and unshareable objects
#
# When the object is sent to and from the ractor, it is important to understand whether the
# object is shareable or unshareable. Most of objects are unshareable objects.
#
# Shareable objects are basically those which can be used by several threads without compromising
# thread-safety; e.g. immutable ones. Ractor.shareable? allows to check this, and Ractor.make_shareable
# tries to make object shareable if it is not.
#
#     Ractor.shareable?(1)            #=> true -- numbers and other immutable basic values are
#     Ractor.shareable?('foo')        #=> false, unless the string is frozen due to # freeze_string_literals: true
#     Ractor.shareable?('foo'.freeze) #=> true
#
#     ary = ['hello', 'world']
#     ary.frozen?                 #=> false
#     ary[0].frozen?              #=> false
#     Ractor.make_shareable(ary)
#     ary.frozen?                 #=> true
#     ary[0].frozen?              #=> true
#     ary[1].frozen?              #=> true
#
# When a shareable object is sent (via #send or Ractor.yield), no additional processing happens,
# and it just becomes usable by both ractors. When an unshareable object is sent, it can be
# either _copied_ or _moved_. The first is the default, and it makes the object's full copy by
# deep cloning of non-shareable parts of its structure.
#
#     data = ['foo', 'bar'.freeze]
#     r = Ractor.new do
#       data2 = Ractor.receive
#       puts "In ractor: #{data2.object_id}, #{data2[0].object_id}, #{data2[1].object_id}"
#     end
#     r.send(data)
#     r.take
#     puts "Outside  : #{data.object_id}, #{data[0].object_id}, #{data[1].object_id}"
#
# This will output:
#
#     In ractor: 340, 360, 320
#     Outside  : 380, 400, 320
#
# (Note that object id of both array and non-frozen string inside array have changed inside
# the ractor, showing it is different objects. But the second array's element, which is a
# shareable frozen string, has the same object_id.)
#
# Deep cloning of the objects may be slow, and sometimes impossible. Alternatively,
# <tt>move: true</tt> may be used on sending. This will <em>move</em> the object to the
# receiving ractor, making it inaccessible for a sending ractor.
#
#     data = ['foo', 'bar']
#     r = Ractor.new do
#       data_in_ractor = Ractor.receive
#       puts "In ractor: #{data_in_ractor.object_id}, #{data_in_ractor[0].object_id}"
#     end
#     r.send(data, move: true)
#     r.take
#     puts "Outside: moved? #{Ractor::MovedObject === data}"
#     puts "Outside: #{data.inspect}"
#
# This will output:
#
#     In ractor: 100, 120
#     Outside: moved? true
#     test.rb:9:in `method_missing': can not send any methods to a moved object (Ractor::MovedError)
#
# Notice that even +inspect+ (and more basic methods like <tt>__id__</tt>) is inaccessible
# on a moved object.
#
# Besides frozen objects, there are shareable objects. Class and Module objects are shareable so
# the Class/Module definitons are shared between ractors. Ractor objects are also shareable objects.
# All operations for the shareable mutable objects are thread-safe, so the thread-safety property
# will be kept. We can not define mutable shareable objects in Ruby, but C extensions can introduce them.
#
# It is prohibited to access instance variables of mutable shareable objects (especially Modules and classes)
# from ractors other than main:
#
#     class C
#       class << self
#         attr_accessor :tricky
#       end
#     end
#
#     C.tricky = 'test'
#
#     r = Ractor.new(C) do |cls|
#       puts "I see #{cls}"
#       puts "I can't see #{cls.tricky}"
#     end
#     r.take
#     # I see C
#     # can not access instance variables of classes/modules from non-main Ractors (RuntimeError)
#
# Ractors can access constants if they are shareable. The main Ractor is the only one that can
# access non-shareable constants.
#
#     GOOD = 'good'.freeze
#     BAD = 'bad'
#
#     r = Ractor.new do
#       puts "GOOD=#{GOOD}"
#       puts "BAD=#{BAD}"
#     end
#     r.take
#     # GOOD=good
#     # can not access non-shareable objects in constant Object::BAD by non-main Ractor. (NameError)
#
#     # Consider the same C class from above
#
#     r = Ractor.new do
#       puts "I see #{C}"
#       puts "I can't see #{C.tricky}"
#     end
#     r.take
#     # I see C
#     # can not access instance variables of classes/modules from non-main Ractors (RuntimeError)
#
# See also the description of <tt># shareable_constant_value</tt> pragma in
# {Comments syntax}[rdoc-ref:doc/syntax/comments.rdoc] explanation.
#
# == Ractors vs threads
#
# Each ractor creates its own thread. New threads can be created from inside ractor
# (and, on CRuby, sharing GVL with other threads of this ractor).
#
#     r = Ractor.new do
#       a = 1
#       Thread.new {puts "Thread in ractor: a=#{a}"}.join
#     end
#     r.take
#     # Here "Thread in ractor: a=1" will be printed
#
# == Note on code examples
#
# In examples below, sometimes we use the following method to wait till ractors that
# are not currently blocked will finish (or process till next blocking) method.
#
#     def wait
#       sleep(0.1)
#     end
#
# It is **only for demonstration purposes** and shouldn't be used in a real code.
# Most of the times, just #take is used to wait till ractor will finish.
#
# == Reference

# See {Ractor desgin doc}[rdoc-ref:doc/ractor.md] for more details.
