 * `data` is assumed to be a valid pointer pointing to well-formed data. The

 * | # bytes | field                      |
 * | ------- | -------------------------- |
 * | `4`     | the length of the filepath |
 * | ...     | the filepath bytes         |
 * | `4`     | the line number            |
 * | `4`     | the length the encoding    |
 * | ...     | the encoding bytes         |
 * | `1`     | frozen string literal      |
 * | `1`     | suppress warnings          |
 * | `4`     | the number of scopes       |
 * | ...     | the scopes                 |
 *
 * Each scope is layed out as follows:
 *
 * | # bytes | field                      |
 * | ------- | -------------------------- |
 * | `4`     | the number of locals       |
 * | ...     | the locals                 |
 *
 * Each local is layed out as follows:
 *
 * | # bytes | field                      |
 * | ------- | -------------------------- |
 * | `4`     | the length of the local    |
 * | ...     | the local bytes            |
 *
 * Some additional things to note about this layout:
 *
 * * The filepath can have a length of 0, in which case we'll consider it an
 *   empty string.
 * * The line number should be 0-indexed.
 * * The encoding can have a length of 0, in which case we'll use the default
 *   encoding (UTF-8). If it's not 0, it should correspond to a name of an
 *   encoding that can be passed to `Encoding.find` in Ruby.
 * * The frozen string literal and suppress warnings fields are booleans, so
 *   their values should be either 0 or 1.
 * * The number of scopes can be 0.
 *
 * @param options The options struct to deserialize into.
 * @param data The binary string to deserialize from.
