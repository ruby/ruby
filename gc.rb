# for gc.c

#  The \GC module provides an interface to Ruby's mark-and-sweep garbage collection mechanism.
#
#  Some of the underlying methods are also available via the ObjectSpace module.
#
#  You may obtain information about the operation of the \GC through GC::Profiler.
module GC

  # Initiates garbage collection, even if explicitly disabled by GC.disable.
  #
  # Keyword arguments:
  #
  # - +full_mark+:
  #   its boolean value determines whether to perform a major garbage collection cycle:
  #
  #   - +true+: initiates a major garbage collection cycle,
  #     meaning all objects (old and new) are marked.
  #   - +false+: initiates a minor garbage collection cycle,
  #     meaning only young objects are marked.
  #
  # - +immediate_mark+:
  #   its boolean value determines whether to perform incremental marking:
  #
  #   - +true+: marking is completed before the method returns.
  #   - +false+: marking is performed by parts,
  #     interleaved with program execution both before the method returns and afterward;
  #     therefore marking may not be completed before the return.
  #     Note that if +full_mark+ is +false+, marking will always be immediate,
  #     regardless of the value of +immediate_mark+.
  #
  # - +immediate_sweep+:
  #   its boolean value determines whether to defer sweeping (using lazy sweep):
  #
  #   - +true+: sweeping is completed before the method returns.
  #   - +false+: sweeping is performed by parts,
  #     interleaved with program execution both before the method returns and afterward;
  #     therefore sweeping may not be completed before the return.
  #
  # Note that these keword arguments are implementation- and version-dependent,
  # are not guaranteed to be future-compatible,
  # and may be ignored in some implementations.
