//! Optimized [usize] casting trait.

#![allow(clippy::wrong_self_convention)]

/// Trait for casting to [usize] that allows you to say `.as_usize()`.
/// Implementation conditional on the cast preserving the numeric value on
/// all inputs and being inexpensive.
///
/// [usize] is only guaranteed to be more than 16-bit wide, so we can't use
/// `.into()` to cast an `u32` or an `u64` to a `usize` even though in all
/// the platforms we support these casts are pretty much no-ops.
/// We could say `as usize` or `.try_convert().unwrap()` everywhere for these
/// casts but both options have undesirable consequences if and when we decide to
/// support 32-bit platforms. Unfortunately we can't implement [::core::convert::From]
/// for [usize] since both the trait and the type are external. Also, naming
/// the method `into()` also causes a name conflict.
