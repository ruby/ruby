# What's Ruby

Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented
programming.  It has many features to process text files and to do system
management tasks (as in Perl).  It is simple, straight-forward, and
extensible.

## Features of Ruby

*   Simple Syntax
*   **Normal** Object-Oriented features(ex. class, method calls)
*   **Advanced** Object-Oriented features(ex. Mix-in, Singleton-method)
*   Operator Overloading
*   Exception Handling
*   Iterators and Closures
*   Garbage Collection
*   Dynamic Loading of Object files(on some architecture)
*   Highly Portable (works on many Unix-like/POSIX compatible platforms as
    well as Windows, Mac OS X, BeOS etc.) cf.

## How to get Ruby

For a complete list of ways to install Ruby, including using third party tools
like rvm, see:

http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

The Ruby distribution files can be found in the following FTP site:

ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/

The trunk of the Ruby source tree can be checked out with the following
command:

    $ svn co http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/trunk/ ruby

Or if you are using git then use the following command:

    $ git clone git://github.com/ruby/ruby.git

There are some other branches under development.  Try the following command
and see the list of branches:

    $ svn ls http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/branches/

Or if you are using git then use the following command:

    $ git ls-remote git://github.com/ruby/ruby.git

## How to compile and install

This is what you need to do to compile and install Ruby:

1.  If you want to use Microsoft Visual C++ to compile ruby, read
    win32/README.win32 instead of this document.

2.  If `./configure` does not exist or is older than configure.in, run
    autoconf to (re)generate configure.

3.  Run `./configure`, which will generate config.h and Makefile.

    Some C compiler flags may be added by default depending on your
    environment.  Specify `optflags=..` and `warnflags=..` as necessary to
    override them.

4.  Edit `defines.h` if you need. Usually this step will not be needed.

5.  Remove comment mark(`#`) before the module names from `ext/Setup` (or add
    module names if not present), if you want to link modules statically.

    If you don't want to compile non static extension modules (probably on
    architectures which does not allow dynamic loading), remove comment mark
    from the line "`#option nodynamic`" in `ext/Setup`.

    Usually this step will not be needed.

6.  Run `make`.

7.  Optionally, run '`make check`' to check whether the compiled Ruby
    interpreter works well. If you see the message "`check succeeded`", your
    ruby works as it should (hopefully).

8.  Run '`make install`'

    This command will create following directories and install files onto
    them.

    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/bin`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/include/ruby-${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/include/ruby-${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}/${PLATFOR
        M}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}/${PLATFORM}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/site_ruby`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/site_ruby/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/site_ruby/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}/${P
        LATFORM}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}/$
        {PLATFORM}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/gems/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/share/man/man1`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/share/ri/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}/system`


    If Ruby's API version is '*x.y.z*', the `${MAJOR}` is '*x*', the
    `${MINOR}` is '*y*', and the `${TEENY}` is '*z*'.

    **NOTE**: teeny of the API version may be different from one of Ruby's
    program version

    You may have to be a super user to install ruby.


If you fail to compile ruby, please send the detailed error report with the
error log and machine/OS type, to help others.

Some extension libraries may not get compiled because of lack of necessary
external libraries and/or headers, then you will need to run '`make
distclean-ext`' to remove old configuration after installing them in such
case.

## Copying

See the file `COPYING`.

## Feedback

Questions about the Ruby language can be asked on the Ruby-Talk mailing list
(http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/mailing-lists) or on websites like
(http://stackoverflow.com).

Bug reports should be filed at http://bugs.ruby-lang.org
