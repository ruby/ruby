# What is Ruby?

Ruby is an interpreted object-oriented programming language often
used for web development. It also offers many scripting features
to process plain text and serialized files, or manage system tasks.
It is simple, straightforward, and extensible.

## Features of Ruby

* Simple Syntax
* **Normal** Object-oriented Features (e.g. class, method calls)
* **Advanced** Object-oriented Features (e.g. mix-in, singleton-method)
* Operator Overloading
* Exception Handling
* Iterators and Closures
* Garbage Collection
* Dynamic Loading of Object Files (on some architectures)
* Highly Portable (works on many Unix-like/POSIX compatible platforms as
  well as Windows, macOS, etc.) cf.
