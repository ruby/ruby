    * Kernel#itself
  * Improvements
    * Kernel#throw raises UncaughtThrowError, subclass of ArgumentError when
      there is no corresponding catch block, instead of ArgumentError.

* Process
  * Extended method:
    * Process execution methods such as Process.spawn opens the file in write
      mode for redirect from [:out, :err].

* String
  * New methods:
    * String#unicode_normalize
    * String#unicode_normalize!

=== Core classes compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

* Enumerable
  * Enumerable#slice_before's state management deprecated.
  * Enumerable#chunk's state management deprecated.

* GC
  * incompatible changes:
    * Rename GC.stat entries. [Feature #9924]
      See https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Ua4uBr6o0k-nORrZLEIIUkHJ9JRzRR0NyZfrhEEnc8/edit?usp=sharing

* Hash
  * incompatible changes:
    * Change overriding policy for duplicated key. [Bug #10315]
      { **hash1, **hash2 } contains values of hash2 for duplicated keys.

* IO
  * incompatible changes:
    * When flushing file IO with IO#flush, you cannot assume that the metadata
      of the file is updated immediately.  On some platforms (especially
      Windows), it is delayed until the filesystem load is decreased.
      Use IO#fsync if you want to guarantee updating metadata.

* Math
  * incompatible changes:
    * Math.log now raises Math::DomainError instead of returning NaN if the
      base is less than 0, and returns NaN instead of -infinity if both of
      two arguments are 0.
    * Math.atan2 now returns values like as expected by C99 if both two
      arguments are infinity.

* Proc
  * incompatible changes:
    * ArgumentError is no longer raised when lambda Proc is passed as a
      block, and the number of yielded arguments does not match the formal
      arguments of the lambda, if just an array is yielded and its length
      matches.

* Process
  * Process execution methods such as Process.spawn opens the file in write
    mode for redirect from [:out, :err].
    Before Ruby 2.2, it was opened in read mode.

=== Stdlib updates (outstanding ones only)

* Continuation
  * callcc is obsolete. use Fiber instead.

* Digest

  * Digest() should now be thread-safe.  If you have a problem with
    regard to on-demand loading under a multi-threaded environment,
    preload "digest/*" modules on boot or use this method instead of
    directly referencing Digest::*.
  * Digest::HMAC has been removed just as previously noticed.

* DL
  * DL has been removed from stdlib. Please use Fiddle instead!

* Etc
  * New methods:
    * Etc.uname
    * Etc.sysconf
    * Etc.confstr
    * IO#pathconf
    * Etc.nprocessors

* Find, Pathname
  * Extended methods:
    * find method accepts "ignore_error" keyword argument.

* Matrix
  * New methods:
    * Matrix#first_minor(row, column) returns the submatrix obtained
      by deleting the specified row and column.
    * Matrix#cofactor(row, column) returns the (row, column) cofactor
      which is obtained by multiplying the first minor by (-1)**(row + column).
    * Matrix#adjugate returns the adjugate of the matrix.
    * hstack and vstack are new instance and class methods to stack matrices
      horizontally and vertically.
    * Matrix#laplace_expansion(row_or_column: num) returns the laplace_expansion
      along the +num+ -th row or column.
    * Vector.basis(size:, index:) returns the specified basis vector.
    * Unary - and + added for Vector and Matrix.
    * Vector#cross_product generalized to arbitrary dimensions.
    * Vector#dot and #cross are aliases for #inner_product and #cross_product.
    * Vector#angle_with returns the angle with its argument
    * New instance and class method independent? to test linear independence.

* Pathname
  * Pathname#/ is aliased to Pathname#+.
  * New methods:
    * Pathname#birthtime

* Rake
  * Updated to Rake 10.4.0.  For full release notes see:

    http://docs.seattlerb.org/rake/History_rdoc.html#label-10.4.0

* RubyGems
  * Updated to RubyGems 2.4.2.  For full release notes see:

    http://docs.seattlerb.org/rubygems/History_txt.html#label-2.4.2+%2F+2014-10-01

* TSort
  * TSort.tsort_each, TSort.each_strongly_connected_component and
    TSort.each_strongly_connected_component_from returns an enumerator if
    no block given.

  * Added new parser class named LibXMLStreamParser.

=== Stdlib compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

* lib/mathn.rb
  * Show deprecated warning [Feature #10169]

* ext/date/lib/date/format.rb
  * Removed because it's empty file.

* Digest
  * Digest::HMAC has finally ceased to exist.  Use OpenSSL::HMAC or an external gem instead.

* time.rb
  * Time.parse, Time.strptime, Time.rfc2822, Time.xmlschema may produce
    fixed-offset Time objects.
    It is happen when usual localtime doesn't preserve the offset from UTC.
  * Time.httpdate produces always UTC Time object.
  * Time.strptime raises ArgumentError when no date information.

* lib/rational.rb
  * Removed because it is deprecated from 2009.

* lib/complex.rb
  * Removed because it is deprecated from 2009.

* lib/prettyprint.rb
  * Removed PrettyPrint#first?

* lib/minitest/*.rb
  * Removed because it conflicts to minitest 5. [Feature #9711]

* lib/test/**/*.rb
  * Removed because it conflicts to minitest 5, and it was just an wrapper
    of minitest 4. [Feature #9711]

* lib/uri
  * support RFC 3986. [Feature #2542]

* GServer
  * GServer is extracted to gserver gem. It's unmaintain code.

* Logger
  * Logger::Application is extracted to logger-application gem. It's unmaintain code.

* ObjectSpace (after requiring "objspace")
  * ObjectSpace.memsize_of(obj) returns a size includes sizeof(RVALUE).
    [Bug #8984]

* Prime
  * incompatible changes:
    * Prime.prime? now returns false for negative numbers. This method
      should not be used to know the number is composite or not. [Bug #7395]

* Psych
  * Removed Psych::EngineManager [Bug #8344]

=== Built-in global variables compatibility issues

=== C API updates

* Deprecated APIs removed.  [Feature #9502]

  Check_SafeStr -> SafeStringValue
  rb_check_safe_str -> SafeStringValue
  rb_quad_pack -> rb_integer_pack
  rb_quad_unpack -> rb_integer_unpack
  rb_read_check : access struct FILE internal. no replacement.
  rb_struct_iv_get : internal function. no replacement.
  struct rb_blocking_region_buffer : internal type. no replacement.

* struct RBignum is hidden.  [Feature #6083]
  Use rb_integer_pack and rb_integer_unpack instead.

* struct RRational is hidden.  [Feature #9513]
  Use rb_rational_num and rb_rational_den instead.

* rb_big_new and rb_big_resize takes a size_t instead of long.

* rb_num2long returns a long instead of SIGNED_VALUE.

* rb_num2ulong returns an unsigned long instead of VALUE.

* st hash table uses power-of-two sizes for speed [Feature #9425].
  Lookups are 10-25% faster if using appropriate hash functions.
  However, weaknesses in hash distribution can no longer be masked
  by prime number-sized tables, so extensions may need to tweak
  hash functions to ensure good distribution.

* rb_sym2str() added. This is almost same as `rb_id2str(SYM2ID(sym))`
  but not pinning a dynamic symbol.

* rb_str_cat_cstr() added. This is same as `rb_str_cat2()`.

* `rb_str_substr()` and `rb_str_subseq()` will share middle of a string,
  but not only the end of a string, in the future.  Therefore, result
  strings may not be NUL-terminated, `StringValueCStr()` is needed
  calling to obtain a NUL-terminated C string.

* rb_tracepoint_new() supports new internal events accessible only from C:
  * RUBY_INTERNAL_EVENT_GC_ENTER
  * RUBY_INTERNAL_EVENT_GC_EXIT
    r47528

* rb_hash_delete() now does not call the block given to the current method.

* rb_extract_keywords() and rb_get_kwargs() exported.  See README.EXT
  for details.

=== Build system updates

* jemalloc is optionally supported via `./configure --with-jemalloc`
  jemalloc may be suitable when system malloc is slow or prone
  to fragmentation.  [Feature #9113]

=== Implementation changes

* GC
    * Most symbols which are returned by String#to_sym and
      String#intern are GC-able [Feature #9634]
    * Introduce incremental marking for major GC. [Feature #10137]
    * Enable lazy sweep on GC caused by malloc().

* VM
    * Use frozen string literals for Hash#[] and Hash#[]=
    * Fast keyword arguments passing [Feature #10440]
    * Allow to receive huge splatted array by a rest argument
      [Feature #10440]

* Process
    * Process creation methods, such as spawn(), uses vfork() system call.
      vfork() is faster than fork() when the parent process uses huge memory.
