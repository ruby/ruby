# Testing Ruby

## Test suites

There are several test suites in the Ruby codebase:

We can run any of the make scripts [in parallel](building_ruby.md#label-Running+make+scripts+in+parallel) to speed them up.

1. [bootstraptest/](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/tree/master/bootstraptest)

    This is a small test suite that runs on Miniruby (see [building Ruby](building_ruby.md#label-Miniruby+vs+Ruby)). We can run it with:

    ```
    make btest
    ```

    To run it with logs, we can use:

    ```
    make btest OPTS=-v
    ```

    To run an individual bootstrap test, we can set the filename in the environment variable `BTESTS`:

    ```
    make btest BTESTS=bootstraptest/test_gc.rb
    ```

    If we want to run the bootstrap test suite on Ruby (not Miniruby), we can use:

    ```
    make test
    ```

    To run it with logs, we can use:

    ```
    make test OPTS=-v
    ```

    To run a file or directory with GNU make, we can use:

    ```
    make test/ruby/test_foo.rb
    make test/ruby/test_foo.rb TESTOPTS="-n /test_bar/"
    ```

2. [test/](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/tree/master/test)

    This is a more comprehensive test suite that runs on Ruby. We can run it with:

    ```
    make test-all
    ```

    We can run a specific test directory in this suite using the `TESTS` option, for example:

    ```
    make test-all TESTS=test/rubygems
    ```

    We can run a specific test file in this suite by also using the `TESTS` option, for example:

    ```
    make test-all TESTS=test/ruby/test_array.rb
    ```

    We can run a specific test in this suite using the `TESTS` option, specifying
    first the file name, and then the test name, prefixed with `--name`. For example:

    ```
    make test-all TESTS="../test/ruby/test_alias.rb --name=/test_alias_with_zsuper_method/"
    ```

    To run these specs with logs, we can use:

    ```
    make test-all TESTS=-v
    ```

    If we would like to run both the `test/` and `bootstraptest/` test suites, we can run

    ```
    make check
    ```

3. [spec/ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/tree/master/spec/ruby)

    This is a test suite that exists in [the Ruby spec repository](https://github.com/ruby/spec) and is mirrored into the `spec/ruby` directory in the Ruby repository. It tests the behavior of the Ruby programming language. We can run this using:

    ```
    make test-spec
    ```

    To run a specific directory, we can use `MSPECOPT` to specify the directory:

    ```
    make test-spec MSPECOPT=spec/ruby/core/array
    ```

    To run a specific file, we can also use `MSPECOPT` to specify the file:

    ```
    make test-spec MSPECOPT=spec/ruby/core/array/any_spec.rb
    ```

    To run a specific test, we can use the `--example` flag to match against the test name:

    ```
    make test-spec MSPECOPT="../spec/ruby/core/array/any_spec.rb --example='is false if the array is empty'"
    ```

    To run these specs with logs, we can use:

    ```
    make test-spec MSPECOPT=-Vfs
    ```

    To run a ruby-spec file or directory with GNU make, we can use

    ```
    make spec/ruby/core/foo/bar_spec.rb
    ```

4. [spec/bundler](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/tree/master/spec/bundler)

    The bundler test suite exists in [the RubyGems repository](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/tree/master/bundler/spec) and is mirrored into the `spec/bundler` directory in the Ruby repository. We can run this using:

    ```
    make test-bundler
    ```

    To run a specific bundler spec file, we can use `BUNDLER_SPECS` as follows:

    ```
    $ make test-bundler BUNDLER_SPECS=commands/exec_spec.rb
    ```
