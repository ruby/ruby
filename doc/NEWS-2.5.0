=== Stdlib updates (outstanding ones only)

* BigDecimal

  * Update to BigDecimal 1.3.4

  * The following features are added:

    * BigDecimal::VERSION

  * The following features have been deprecated,
    and are planned to be removed in the version 1.4.0:

    * BigDecimal.new

    * BigDecimal.ver

  * BigDecimal#clone and #dup now do not make a new instance,
    but returns the receiver itself.

* Coverage

  * Support branch coverage and method coverage measurement. [Feature #13901]
    Branch coverage tells you which branches are executed, and which not.
    Method coverage tells you which methods are invoked, and which not.
    By running a test suite with this new feature, you can know which branches
    and methods are executed by a test, and evaluate total coverage of a test
    suite more strictly.

    You can specify the measuring target by an option to `Coverage.start`:

        Coverage.start(lines: true, branches: true, methods: true)

    After some Ruby files are loaded, you can use `Coverage.result` to get
    the coverage result:

        Coverage.result
        #=> { "/path/to/file.rb"=>
        #     { :lines => [1, 2, 0, nil, ...],
        #       :branches =>
        #         { [:if, 0, 2, 1, 6, 4] =>
        #             { [:then, 1, 3, 2, 3, 8] => 0,
        #               [:else, 2, 5, 2, 5, 8] => 2
        #             }
        #         },
        #       :methods => {
        #          [Object, :foo, 1, 0, 7, 3] => 2
        #       }
        #     }
        #   }

    The result type of line coverage is not changed; it is just an array that
    contains numbers, which means the count that each line was executed,
    or `nil`s, which means that the line is not relevant.

    The result type of branch coverage is:

        { (jump base) => { (jump target) => (counter) } }

    where jump base and targets have the format

        [type, unique-id, start lineno, start column, end lineno, end column]

    For example, `[:if, 0, 2, 1, 6, 4]` reads an `if` statement that ranges from
    line 2 and column 1, to line 6 and column 4.  `[:then, 1, 3, 2, 3, 8]` reads
    a `then` clause that ranges from line 3 and column 2, to line 3 and column 8.
    Note that lineno starts from 1, and that columnno starts from 0.  So, the
    above example shows a branch from the `if` to the `then` was never executed,
    and a branch from the `if` to the `else` was executed twice.

    The result type of method coverage is:

        { (method key) => (counter) }

    where method key has the format

        [class, method-name, start lineno, start column, end lineno, end column]

    For example, `[Object, :foo, 1, 0, 7, 3]` reads `Object#foo` that ranges from
    line 1 and column 0, to line 7 and column 3.  The above example shows this
    `Object#foo` was invoked twice.

    Note: To keep compatibility, passing no option to `Coverage.start` will measure
    only line coverage, and `Coverage.result` will return the old format:

        Coverage.result
        #=> { "/path/to/file.rb"=> [1, 2, 0, nil, ...] }

* DRb

  * ACL::ACLEntry.new no longer suppresses IPAddr::InvalidPrefixError.

* ERB

  * Add ERB#result_with_hash to render a template with local variables passed
    with a Hash object. [Feature #8631]

  * Default template file encoding is changed from ASCII-8BIT to UTF-8 in erb
    command. [Bug #14095]

  * Carriage returns are changed to be trimmed properly if trim_mode is specified
    and used. Duplicated newlines will be removed on Windows. [Bug #5339] [Bug #11464]

* IPAddr

  * IPAddr no longer accepts invalid address mask. [Bug #13399]
  * IPAddr#ipv4_compat and IPAddr#ipv4_compat? are marked for deprecation. [Bug #13769]

  * New methods:

    * IPAddr#prefix
    * IPAddr#loopback?
    * IPAddr#private? [Feature #11666]
    * IPAddr#link_local? [Feature #10912]

* IRB

  * Print backtrace and error message in reverse order [Feature #8661] [experimental]

  and a tty. [Feature #8661] [experimental]

* Print error message in bold/underlined text if $stderr is unchanged and a
  tty. [Feature #14140] [experimental]

* configure option --with-ext now mandates its arguments.  So for
  instance if you run ./configure --with-ext=openssl,+ then the
  openssl library is guaranteed compiled, otherwise the build fails
  abnormally.

  Note however to always add the ",+" at the end of the argument.
  Otherwise nothing but openssl are built.  [Feature #13302]
