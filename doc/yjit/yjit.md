YJIT - Yet Another Ruby JIT
===========================

YJIT is a lightweight, minimalistic Ruby JIT built inside CRuby.
It lazily compiles code using a Basic Block Versioning (BBV) architecture. The target use case is that of servers running
Ruby on Rails, an area where MJIT has not yet managed to deliver speedups.
YJIT is currently supported for macOS and Linux on x86-64 and arm64/aarch64 CPUs.
This project is open source and falls under the same license as CRuby.

## Current Limitations

YJIT may not be suitable for certain applications. It currently only supports macOS and Linux on x86-64 and arm64/aarch64 CPUs. YJIT will use more memory than the Ruby interpreter because the JIT compiler needs to generate machine code in memory and maintain additional state
information.
You can change how much executable memory is allocated using [YJIT's command-line options](#command-line-options). There is a slight performance tradeoff because allocating less executable memory could result in the generated machine code being collected more often.

## Installation

### Requirements

You will need to install:
- A C compiler such as GCC or Clang
- GNU Make and Autoconf
- The Rust compiler `rustc` and Cargo (if you want to build in dev/debug mode)
  - The Rust version must be [>= 1.58.0](../../yjit/Cargo.toml).

To install the Rust build toolchain, we suggest following the [recommended installation method][rust-install]. Rust also provides first class [support][editor-tools] for many source code editors.

[rust-install]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
[editor-tools]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools

### Building YJIT

Start by cloning the `ruby/ruby` repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ruby/ruby yjit
cd yjit
```

The YJIT `ruby` binary can be built with either GCC or Clang. It can be built either in dev (debug) mode or in release mode. For maximum performance, compile YJIT in release mode with GCC. More detailed build instructions are provided in the [Ruby README](https://github.com/ruby/ruby#how-to-compile-and-install).

```
# Configure in release mode for maximum performance, build and install
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-yjit --prefix=$HOME/.rubies/ruby-yjit --disable-install-doc
make -j install
```

or

```
# Configure in dev (debug) mode for development, build and install
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-yjit=dev --prefix=$HOME/.rubies/ruby-yjit --disable-install-doc
make -j install
```

On macOS, you may need to specify where to find some libraries:

```
# Install dependencies
brew install openssl readline libyaml

# Configure in dev (debug) mode for development, build and install
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-yjit=dev --prefix=$HOME/.rubies/ruby-yjit --disable-install-doc --with-opt-dir="$(brew --prefix openssl):$(brew --prefix readline):$(brew --prefix libyaml)"
make -j install
```

Typically configure will choose the default C compiler. To specify the C compiler, use

```
# Choosing a specific c compiler
export CC=/path/to/my/chosen/c/compiler
```

before running `./configure`.

You can test that YJIT works correctly by running:

```
# Quick tests found in /bootstraptest
make btest

# Complete set of tests
make -j test-all
```

## Usage

### Examples

Once YJIT is built, you can either use `./miniruby` from within your build directory, or switch to the YJIT version of `ruby`
by using the `chruby` tool:

```
chruby ruby-yjit
ruby myscript.rb
```

You can dump statistics about compilation and execution by running YJIT with the `--yjit-stats` command-line option:

```
./miniruby --yjit-stats myscript.rb
```

The machine code generated for a given method can be printed by adding `puts RubyVM::YJIT.disasm(method(:method_name))` to a Ruby script. Note that no code will be generated if the method is not compiled.

### Command-Line Options

YJIT supports all command-line options supported by upstream CRuby, but also adds a few YJIT-specific options:

- `--yjit`: enable YJIT (disabled by default)
- `--yjit-call-threshold=N`: number of calls after which YJIT begins to compile a function (default 30)
- `--yjit-exec-mem-size=N`: size of the executable memory block to allocate, in MiB (default 128 MiB)
- `--yjit-stats`: produce statistics after the execution of a program
- `--yjit-trace-exits`: produce a Marshal dump of backtraces from specific exits. Automatically enables `--yjit-stats` (must configure and build with `--enable-yjit=stats` to use this)
- `--yjit-max-versions=N`: maximum number of versions to generate per basic block (default 4)
- `--yjit-greedy-versioning`: greedy versioning mode (disabled by default, may increase code size)

Note that there is also an environment variable `RUBY_YJIT_ENABLE` which can be used to enable YJIT.
This can be useful for some deployment scripts where specifying an extra command-line option to Ruby is not practical.

### Benchmarking

We have collected a set of benchmarks and implemented a simple benchmarking harness in the [yjit-bench](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-bench) repository. This benchmarking harness is designed to disable CPU frequency scaling, set process affinity and disable address space randomization so that the variance between benchmarking runs will be as small as possible. Please kindly note that we are at an early stage in this project.

### Performance Tips

This section contains tips on writing Ruby code that will run as fast as possible on YJIT. Some of this advice is based on current limitations of YJIT, while other advice is broadly applicable. It probably won't be practical to apply these tips everywhere in your codebase, but you can profile your code using a tool such as [stackprof](https://github.com/tmm1/stackprof) and refactor the specific methods that make up the largest fractions of the execution time.

- Use exceptions for error recovery only, not as part of normal control-flow
- Avoid redefining basic integer operations (i.e. +, -, <, >, etc.)
- Avoid redefining the meaning of `nil`, equality, etc.
- Avoid allocating objects in the hot parts of your code
- Use while loops if you can, instead of `integer.times`
- Minimize layers of indirection
  - Avoid classes that wrap objects if you can
  - Avoid methods that just call another method, trivial one liner methods
- CRuby method calls are costly. Favor larger methods over smaller methods.
- Try to write code so that the same variables always have the same type

You can also use the `--yjit-stats` command-line option to see which bytecodes cause YJIT to exit, and refactor your code to avoid using these instructions in the hottest methods of your code.

### Other Statistics

If you compile Ruby with `RUBY_DEBUG` and/or `YJIT_STATS` defined and run with `--yjit --yjit-stats`, YJIT will track and return performance statistics in `RubyVM::YJIT.runtime_stats`.

```
$ RUBYOPT="--yjit --yjit-stats" irb
irb(main):001:0> RubyVM::YJIT.runtime_stats
=>
{:inline_code_size=>340745,
 :outlined_code_size=>297664,
 :all_stats=>true,
 :exec_instruction=>1547816,
 :send_callsite_not_simple=>7267,
 :send_kw_splat=>7,
 :send_ivar_set_method=>72,
...
```

Some of the counters include:

:exec_instruction - how many Ruby bytecode instructions have been executed
:binding_allocations - number of bindings allocated
:binding_set - number of variables set via a binding
:vm_insns_count - number of instructions executed by the Ruby interpreter
:compiled_iseq_count - number of bytecode sequences compiled

Counters starting with "exit_" show reasons for YJIT code taking a side exit (return to the interpreter.) See yjit_hacking.md for more details.

Performance counter names are not guaranteed to remain the same between Ruby versions. If you're curious what one does, it's usually best to search the source code for it &mdash; but it may change in a later Ruby version.

## Contributing

We welcome open source contributors. You should feel free to open new issues to report bugs or just to ask questions.
Suggestions on how to make this readme file more helpful for new contributors are most welcome.

Bug fixes and bug reports are very valuable to us. If you find a bug in YJIT, it's very possible be that nobody has reported it before,
or that we don't have a good reproduction for it, so please open an issue and provide as much information as you can about your configuration and a description of how you encountered the problem. List the commands you used to run YJIT so that we can easily reproduce the issue on our end and investigate it. If you are able to produce a small program reproducing the error to help us track it down, that is very much appreciated as well.

If you would like to contribute a large patch to YJIT, we suggest opening an issue or a discussion on this repository so that
we can have an active discussion. A common problem is that sometimes people submit large pull requests to open source projects
without prior communication, and we have to reject them because the work they implemented does not fit within the design of the
project. We want to save you time and frustration, so please reach out and we can have a productive discussion as to how
you can contribute things we will want to merge into YJIT.

### Source Code Organization

The YJIT source code is divided between:
- `yjit.c`: code YJIT uses to interface with the rest of CRuby
- `yjit.h`: C definitions YJIT exposes to the rest of the CRuby
- `yjit.rb`: `YJIT` Ruby module that is exposed to Ruby
- `yjit/src/asm/*`: in-memory assembler we use to generate machine code
- `yjit/src/codegen.rs`: logic for translating Ruby bytecode to machine code
- `yjit/src/core.rb`: basic block versioning logic, core structure of YJIT
- `yjit/src/stats.rs`: gathering of run-time statistics
- `yjit/src/options.rs`: handling of command-line options
- `yjit/bindgen/src/main.rs`: C bindings exposed to the Rust codebase through bindgen
- `yjit/src/cruby.rs`: C bindings manually exposed to the Rust codebase
- `misc/test_yjit_asm.sh`: script to compile and run the in-memory assembler tests
- `misc/yjit_asm_tests.c`: tests for the in-memory assembler

The core of CRuby's interpreter logic is found in:
- `insns.def`: defines Ruby's bytecode instructions (gets compiled into `vm.inc`)
- `vm_insnshelper.c`: logic used by Ruby's bytecode instructions
- `vm_exec.c`: Ruby interpreter loop

### Generating C bindings with bindgen

In order to expose C functions to the Rust codebase, you will need to generate C bindings:

```sh
CC=clang ./configure --enable-yjit=dev
make -j yjit-bindgen
```

This uses the bindgen tools to generate/update `yjit/src/cruby_bindings.inc.rs` based on the
bindings listed in `yjit/bindgen/src/main.rs`. Avoid manually editing this file
as it could be automatically regenerated at a later time. If you need to manually add C bindings,
add them to `yjit/cruby.rs` instead.

### Coding & Debugging Protips

There are 3 test suites:
- `make btest` (see `/bootstraptest`)
- `make test-all`
- `make test-spec`
- `make check` runs all of the above

The tests can be run in parallel like this:

```
make -j test-all RUN_OPTS="--yjit-call-threshold=1"
```

Or single-threaded like this, to more easily identify which specific test is failing:

```
make test-all TESTOPTS=--verbose RUN_OPTS="--yjit-call-threshold=1"
```

To debug a single test in `test-all`:

```
make test-all TESTS='test/-ext-/marshal/test_usrmarshal.rb' RUNRUBYOPT=--debugger=lldb RUN_OPTS="--yjit-call-threshold=1"
```

You can also run one specific test in `btest`:

```
make btest BTESTS=bootstraptest/test_ractor.rb RUN_OPTS="--yjit-call-threshold=1"
```

There are shortcuts to run/debug your own test/repro in `test.rb`:

```
make run  # runs ./miniruby test.rb
make lldb # launches ./miniruby test.rb in lldb
```

You can use the Intel syntax for disassembly in LLDB, keeping it consistent with YJIT's disassembly:

```
echo "settings set target.x86-disassembly-flavor intel" >> ~/.lldbinit
```

## Running x86 YJIT on Apple's Rosetta

For development purposes, it is possible to run x86 YJIT on an Apple M1 via Rosetta.  You can find basic
instructions below, but there are a few caveats listed further down.

First, install Rosetta:

```
$ softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

Now any command can be run with Rosetta via the `arch` command line tool.

Then you can start your shell in an x86 environment:

```
$ arch -x86_64 zsh
```

You can double check your current architecture via the `arch` command:

```
$ arch -x86_64 zsh
$ arch
i386
```

You may need to set the default target for `rustc` to x86-64, e.g.

```
$ rustup default stable-x86_64-apple-darwin
```

While in your i386 shell, install Cargo and Homebrew, then hack away!

### Rosetta Caveats

1. You must install a version of Homebrew for each architecture
2. Cargo will install in $HOME/.cargo by default, and I don't know a good way to change architectures after install

If you use Fish shell you can [read this link](https://tenderlovemaking.com/2022/01/07/homebrew-rosetta-and-ruby.html) for information on making the dev environment easier.
