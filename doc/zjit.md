# ZJIT: ADVANCED RUBY JIT PROTOTYPE

## Build Instructions

To build ZJIT on macOS:
```
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-zjit=dev --prefix=$HOME/.rubies/ruby-zjit --disable-install-doc --with-opt-dir="$(brew --prefix openssl):$(brew --prefix readline):$(brew --prefix libyaml)"
make -j miniruby
```

## Useful dev commands

To view YARV output for code snippets:
```
./miniruby --dump=insns -e0
```

To run code snippets with ZJIT:
```
./miniruby --zjit -e0
```

You can also try https://www.rubyexplorer.xyz/ to view Ruby YARV disasm output with syntax highlighting
in a way that can be easily shared with other team members.

## Documentation

You can generate and open the source level documentation in your browser using `cargo doc --open --document-private-items`.

## Testing

Make sure you have a `--enable-zjit=dev` build, and install the following tools:
- `brew install cargo-nextest` - Required for running tests
- `cargo install cargo-insta` - Required for updating snapshots

### make zjit-check

This command runs all ZJIT tests: `make zjit-test` and `test/ruby/test_zjit.rb`.

```
make zjit-check
```

### make zjit-test

This command runs Rust unit tests using `insta` for snapshot testing.

```
make zjit-test
```

You can also run a single test case by specifying the function name:

```
make zjit-test ZJIT_TESTS=test_putobject
```

#### Snapshot Testing

ZJIT uses [insta](https://insta.rs/) for snapshot testing. When tests fail due to snapshot mismatches, pending snapshots are created. The test command will notify you if there are pending snapshots:

```
Pending snapshots found. Accept with: make zjit-test-update
```

To update/accept all the snapshot changes:

```
make zjit-test-update
```

You can also review snapshot changes interactively one by one:

```
cd zjit && cargo insta review
```

Test changes will be reviewed alongside code changes.

<summary>Setting up zjit-test</summary>

ZJIT uses `cargo-nextest` for Rust unit tests instead of `cargo test`.
`cargo-nextest` runs each test in its own process, which is valuable since
CRuby only supports booting once per process, and most APIs are not thread
safe. Use `brew install cargo-nextest` to install it on macOS, otherwise, refer
to <https://nexte.st/docs/installation/pre-built-binaries/> for installation
instructions.

Since it uses Cargo, you'll also need a `configure --enable-zjit=dev ...` build
for `make zjit-test`. Since the tests need to link against CRuby, directly
calling `cargo test`, or `cargo nextest` likely won't build. Make sure to
use `make`.

</details>

### test/ruby/test\_zjit.rb

This command runs Ruby execution tests.

```
make test-all TESTS="test/ruby/test_zjit.rb"
```

You can also run a single test case by matching the method name:

```
make test-all TESTS="test/ruby/test_zjit.rb -n TestZJIT#test_putobject"
```

## Statistics Collection

ZJIT provides detailed statistics about JIT compilation and execution behavior.

### Basic Stats

Run with basic statistics printed on exit:

```bash
./miniruby --zjit-stats script.rb
```

Collect stats without printing (access via `RubyVM::ZJIT.stats` in Ruby):

```bash
./miniruby --zjit-stats=quiet script.rb
```

### Accessing Stats in Ruby

```ruby
# Check if stats are enabled
if RubyVM::ZJIT.stats_enabled?
  stats = RubyVM::ZJIT.stats
  puts "Compiled ISEQs: #{stats[:compiled_iseq_count]}"
  puts "Failed ISEQs: #{stats[:failed_iseq_count]}"

  # You can also reset stats during execution
  RubyVM::ZJIT.reset_stats!
end
```

### Performance Ratio

The `ratio_in_zjit` stat shows the percentage of Ruby instructions executed in JIT code vs interpreter. This metric only appears when ZJIT is built with `--enable-zjit=stats` (which enables `rb_vm_insn_count` tracking) and represents a key performance indicator for ZJIT effectiveness.

To build with stats support:

```bash
./configure --enable-zjit=stats
make -j
```

### Tracing side exits

Through [Stackprof](https://github.com/tmm1/stackprof), detailed information about the methods that the JIT side-exits from can be displayed after some execution of a program.

```bash
./miniruby --zjit-trace-exits script.rb
```

A file called `zjit_exit_locations.dump` will be created in the same directory as `script.rb`. Viewing the side exited methods can be done with Stackprof:

```bash
stackprof path/to/zjit_exit_locations.dump
```

## ZJIT Glossary

This glossary contains terms that are helpful for understanding ZJIT.

Please note that some terms may appear in CRuby internals too but with different meanings.

| Term | Definition |
| ---  | -----------|
| HIR | High-level Intermediate Representation. High-level (Ruby semantics) graph representation in static single-assignment (SSA) form |
| LIR | Low-level Intermediate Representation. Low-level IR used in the backend for assembly generation |
| SSA | Static Single Assignment. A form where each variable is assigned exactly once |
| `opnd` | Operand. An operand to an IR instruction (can be register, memory, immediate, etc.) |
| `dst` | Destination. The output operand of an instruction where the result is stored |
| VReg | Virtual Register. A virtual register that gets lowered to physical register or memory |
| `insn_id` | Instruction ID. An index of an instruction in a function |
| `block_id` | The index of a basic block, which effectively acts like a pointer |
| `branch` | Control flow edge between basic blocks in the compiled code |
| `cb` | Code Block. Memory region for generated machine code |
| `entry` | The starting address of compiled code for an ISEQ |
| Patch Point | Location in generated code that can be modified later in case assumptions get invalidated |
| Frame State | Captured state of the Ruby stack frame at a specific point for deoptimization |
| Guard | A run-time check that ensures assumptions are still valid |
| `invariant` | An assumption that JIT code relies on, requiring invalidation if broken |
| Deopt | Deoptimization. Process of falling back from JIT code to interpreter |
| Side Exit | Exit from JIT code back to interpreter |
| Type Lattice | Hierarchy of types used for type inference and optimization |
| Constant Folding | Optimization that evaluates constant expressions at compile time |
| RSP | x86-64 stack pointer register used for native stack operations |
| Register Spilling | Process of moving register values to memory when running out of physical registers |
