(e.g. <tt>https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/$FEATURE_OR_BUG_NUMBER</tt>)

== Changes since the 2.5.0 release

=== Language changes

* <code>$SAFE</code> now is a process global state and can be set to 0 again. [Feature #14250]

* Refinements take place at block passing.  [Feature #14223]

* Refinements take place at Kernel#public_send.  [Feature #15326]

* Refinements take place at Kernel#respond_to?.  [Feature #15327]

* +else+ without +rescue+ now causes a syntax error.  [EXPERIMENTAL] [Feature #14606]

* Constant names may start with a non-ASCII capital letter. [Feature #13770]

* Endless ranges are introduced.  You can use a Range that has no end,
  like <code>(0..)</code> (or similarly <code>(0...)</code>).  [Feature #12912]

  The following shows typical use cases:

    ary[1..]                              # identical to ary[1..-1]
    (1...).each {|index| block }          # infinite loop from index 1
    ary.zip(1..) {|elem, index| block }   # ary.each.with_index(1) { }

* Non-Symbol keys in a keyword arguments hash cause an exception.

* The "shadowing outer local variable" warning is removed.  [Feature #12490]

  You can now write the following without warning:

    user = users.find {|user| cond(user) }

* Print +cause+ of the exception if the exception is not caught and printed
  its backtraces and error message. [Feature #8257]

* The flip-flop syntax is deprecated. [Feature #5400]

=== Core classes updates (outstanding ones only)

[Array]

  [New methods]

    * Added Array#union and Array#difference instance methods.  [Feature #14097]

  [Modified method]

    * Array#to_h now accepts a block that maps elements to new key/value pairs.  [Feature #15143]

  [Aliased methods]

    * Array#filter is a new alias for Array#select. [Feature #13784]
    * Array#filter! is a new alias for Array#select!. [Feature #13784]

[Binding]

  [New method]

    * Added Binding#source_location.  [Feature #14230]

      This method returns the source location of the binding, a 2-element
      array of <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__LINE__</code>.
      Traditionally, the same information could be retrieved by
      <code>eval("[__FILE__, __LINE__]", binding)</code>, but we are
      planning to change this behavior so that Kernel#eval ignores
      binding's source location [Bug #4352].  So, users should use this
      newly-introduced method instead of Kernel#eval.

[Dir]

  [New methods]

    * Added Dir#each_child and Dir#children instance methods. [Feature #13969]

[Enumerable]

[Kernel]

  [Aliased method]

    * Kernel#then is a new alias for Kernel#yield_self. [Feature #14594]

  [New options]

    * Kernel#Complex, Kernel#Float, Kernel#Integer, and
      Kernel#Rational take an +:exception+ option to specify the way of
      error handling.  [Feature #12732]

    * Kernel#system takes an +:exception+ option to raise an exception
      on failure.  [Feature #14386]

  [Incompatible changes]

    * Kernel#system and Kernel#exec do not close non-standard file descriptors
      (the default of the +:close_others+ option is changed to +false+,
      but we still set the +FD_CLOEXEC+ flag on descriptors we
      create).  [Misc #14907]

=== Stdlib updates (outstanding ones only)

[BigDecimal]

  Update to version 1.4.0.  This version includes several compatibility
  issues, see Compatibility issues section below for details.

  [Modified method]

    * BigDecimal() accepts the new keyword "exception:" similar to Float().

  [Note for the differences among recent versions]

    You should want to know the differences among recent versions of bigdecimal.
    Please select the suitable version of bigdecimal according to the following
    information.

    * 1.3.5 has BigDecimal.new without "exception:" keyword.  You can see the
      deprecation warning of BigDecimal.new when you specify "-w" option.
      BigDecimal(), BigDecimal.new, and Object#to_d methods are the same.

    * 1.4.0 has BigDecimal.new with "exception:" keyword.  You always see the
      deprecation warning of BigDecimal.new.  Object#to_d method is different
      from BigDecimal() and BigDecimal.new.

    * 2.0.0 will be released soon after releasing Ruby 2.6.0.  This version
      will not have the BigDecimal.new method.

[Bundler]

  * Add Bundler to Standard Library. [Feature #12733]

  * Use 1.17.2, the latest stable version.

[Coverage]

  A oneshot_lines mode is added.  [Feature #15022]

  This mode checks "whether each line was executed at least once or not",
  instead of "how many times each line was executed".
  A hook for each line is fired at most once, and after it is fired
  the hook flag is removed, i.e., it runs with zero overhead.

  [New options]

    * Add +:oneshot_lines+ keyword argument to Coverage.start.

    * Add +:stop+ and +:clear+ keyword arguments to Coverage.result.
      If +clear+ is true, it clears the counters to zero.
      If +stop+ is true, it disables coverage measurement.

  [New methods]

    * Coverage.line_stub, which is a simple helper function that
      creates the "stub" of line coverage from a given source code.

[CSV]

  * Upgrade to 3.0.2. This includes performance improvements especially
    for writing. Writing is about 2 times faster.
    See https://github.com/ruby/csv/blob/master/NEWS.md.

[ERB]

  [New options]

    * Add +:trim_mode+ and +:eoutvar+ keyword arguments to ERB.new.
      Now non-keyword arguments other than the first one are softly deprecated
      and will be removed when Ruby 2.5 becomes EOL. [Feature #14256]

    * erb command's <tt>-S</tt> option is deprecated, and will be removed
      in the next version.

[FileUtils]

  [New methods]

    * Add Net::HTTP#write_timeout and Net::HTTP#write_timeout=.  [Feature #13396]

  [New constant]

    * Add Net::HTTPClientException to deprecate Net::HTTPServerException,
      whose name is misleading.  [Bug #14688]

[NKF]

  * Upgrade to nkf v2.1.5

[Psych]

  * Upgrade to Psych 3.1.0

[RDoc]

    * <code>string()</code> function: Support context node.

    * <code>string()</code> function: Support processing instruction node.

    * Support <code>"*:#{ELEMENT_NAME}"</code> syntax in XPath 2.0.

  [Fixed some XPath implementations]

    * <code>"//#{ELEMENT_NAME}[#{POSITION}]"</code> case

    * <code>string()</code> function: Fix <code>function(document)</code>
      returns nodes that are out of root elements.

    and is now warned.  [Feature #14643]

[File]

  * File.read, File.binread, File.write, File.binwrite, File.foreach, and
    File.readlines do not invoke external commands even if the path starts
    with the pipe character <code>'|'</code>. [Feature #14245]

[Object]

  * Object#=~ is deprecated.  [Feature #15231]

=== Stdlib compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

* These standard libraries have been promoted to default gems.

  * e2mmap

  * matrix
  * mutex_m
  * ostruct
  * prime
  * rexml
  * rss
  * shell
  * sync
  * thwait
  * tracer

[BigDecimal]

  * The following methods are removed.

    * BigDecimal.allocate
    * BigDecimal.ver

  * Every BigDecimal object is frozen. [Feature #13984]

  * BigDecimal() parses the given string similar to Float().

  * String#to_d parses the receiver string similar to String#to_f.

  * BigDecimal.new will be removed in version 2.0.

[Pathname]

  * Pathname#read, Pathname#binread, Pathname#write, Pathname#binwrite,
    Pathname#each_line and Pathname#readlines do not invoke external
    commands even if the path starts with the pipe character <code>'|'</code>.
    This follows [Feature #14245].

=== Implementation improvements

* Speedup Proc#call because we don't need to care about <code>$SAFE</code>
  any more. [Feature #14318]

  With +lc_fizzbuzz+ benchmark which uses Proc#call many times we can
  measure x1.4 improvements.  [Bug #10212]

* Speedup block.call where +block+ is passed block parameter. [Feature #14330]

  Ruby 2.5 improves block passing performance. [Feature #14045]

  Additionally, Ruby 2.6 improves the performance of passed block calling.

* Introduce an initial implementation of a JIT (Just-in-time) compiler. [Feature #14235] [experimental]

  * <tt>--jit</tt> command line option is added to enable JIT. <tt>--jit-verbose=1</tt>
    is good for inspection.  See <tt>ruby --help</tt> for others.
  * To generate machine code, this JIT compiler uses the C compiler used for building
    the interpreter. Currently GCC, Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++ are supported for it.
  * <tt>--disable-mjit-support</tt> option is added to configure. This is added for JIT debugging,
    but if you get an error on building a header file for JIT, you can use this option to skip
    building it as a workaround.
  * rb_waitpid reimplemented on Unix-like platforms to maintain
    compatibility with processes created for JIT [Bug #14867]

* VM generator script renewal; makes the generated VM more optimized. [GH-1779]

* Thread cache enabled for pthreads platforms (for Thread.new and
  Thread.start).  [Feature #14757]

* timer thread is eliminated for platforms with POSIX timers. [Misc #14937]

* Transient Heap (theap) is supported. [Bug #14858] [Feature #14989]

  theap is a managed heap for short-living memory objects. For example,
  making a small and short-living Hash object is x2 faster. With rdoc benchmark,
  we measured 6-7% performance improvement.

* Native implementations (arm32, arm64, ppc64le, win32, win64, x86, amd64) of
  coroutines to improve performance of Fiber significantly. [Feature #14739]

=== Miscellaneous changes

* On macOS, shared libraries no longer include a full version number of Ruby
  in their names.  This eliminates the burden of each teeny upgrade on the
  platform that users need to rebuild every extension library.
