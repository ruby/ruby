== Changes since the 2.2.0 release

=== Language changes

* frozen-string-literal pragma:

  * new pragma, frozen-string-literal has been experimentally introduced. [Feature #8976]
  * besides, --enable/--disable=frozen-string-literal options also have
    been introduced. [Feature #8976]
  * command line options --debug or --debug=frozen-string-literal enable
    additional debugging mode which shows created location with at frozen
    object error (RuntimeError). [Feature #11725]

* safe navigation operator:

  * new method call syntax, `object&.foo', method #foo is called on
    `object' if it is not nil. [Feature #11537]

    This is similar to `try!' in Active Support, except:
    * method name is syntactically required
          obj.try! {} # valid
          obj&. {}    # syntax error
    * arguments are evaluated only if a call is made:
          obj.try!(:foo, bar())  # bar() is always evaluated
          obj&.foo(bar())        # bar() is conditionally evaluated
    * attribute assignment is valid
          obj&.attr += 1

* the did_you_mean gem:

  * When a NameError or NoMethodError occurs because of a typo in the name,
    the did_you_mean gem automatically suggests other names similar to the
    method name.

      "Yuki".starts_with?("Y")
      # => NoMethodError: undefined method `starts_with?' for "Yuki":String
      #    Did you mean?  start_with?

* indented here document:

  * new string literal, here document starts with `<<~`.
    refer doc/syntax/literals.rdoc for more details. [Feature #9098]

=== Core classes updates (outstanding ones only)

    this flag means to permit deleting opened file on Windows, but currently
    this affect only files opened as binary.  [Feature #11218]

  * new option parameter `flags' is added.
    this parameter is bitwise-ORed to oflags generated by normal mode argument. [Feature #11253]

  * IO#advise no longer raises Errno::ENOSYS in cases where it was
    detected at build time but not available at runtime.  [Feature #11806]

* Kernel

  * Kernel#loop, when stopped by a StopIteration exception, returns
    what the enumerator has returned instead of nil. [Feature #11498]

* Module
  * Module#deprecate_constant [Feature #11398]

* NameError
  * NameError#receiver is added to take the receiver object. [Feature #10881]

    true when the receiver is positive and negative respectively. [Feature #11151]

* Proc

  * Proc#call (and also #[], #===, #yield) are optimized.
    Backtrace doesn't show each method (show block lines directly).
    TracePoint also ignores these calls. [Feature #11569]

* RubyVM::InstructionSequence
  * add the following methods as a primitive tool of iseq loader.
    See sample/iseq_loader.rb for usage.
    Note that loader does not have verifier so it is easy to cause
    critical problem by loading modified/broken binary data.
    See [Feature #11788] for more details. (experimental feature)
    * RubyVM::InstructionSequence#to_binary(extra_data = nil)
    * RubyVM::InstructionSequence.load_from_binary(binary)
    * RubyVM::InstructionSequence.load_from_binary_extra_data(binary)

    initial_state argument.  [Feature #10958]
    Use a local variable instead to maintain a state.

* File::Stat
  * On Windows File::Stat#ino always returned 0, but now returns
    BY_HANDLE_FILE_INFORMATION.nFileIndexHigh/Low.  [Feature #11216]

* Hash
  * Hash#inspect doesn't raise error even if its content returns
    a string which is not compatible with Encoding.default_external
    as inspected result. [Feature #11801]

* IO
  * IO#close doesn't raise when the IO object is closed.  [Feature #10718]
  * IO#each_codepoint raises an exception at incomplete character
    before EOF when conversion takes place.  [Bug #11444]

* Socket
  * Socket#connect_nonblock, Socket#accept_nonblock,
    TCPServer#accept_nonblock, UNIXServer#accept_nonblock,
    BasicSocket#recv_nonblock, BasicSocket#recvmsg_nonblock,
    BasicSocket#sendmsg_nonblock all support `exception: false` to return
    :wait_readable or :wait_writable symbols instead of raising
    IO::WaitReadable or IO::WaitWritable exceptions [Feature #10532] [Feature #11229]
  * BasicSocket#recv and BasicSocket#recv_nonblock allow an output
    String buffer argument like IO#read and IO#read_nonblock to reduce
    GC overhead [Feature #11242]

* StringIO
  * In read-only mode, StringIO#set_encoding no longer sets the encoding
    of its buffer string.  Setting the encoding of the string directly
    without StringIO#set_encoding may cause unpredictable behavior now. [Bug #11827]

=== Built-in global variables compatibility issues

* $SAFE
  * $SAFE=2 and $SAFE=3 are obsolete.  If $SAFE is set to 2 or larger,
    an ArgumentError is raised.  [Feature #5455]

=== C API updates

* rb_define_class_id_under() now raises a TypeError exception when the
  class is already defined but its superclass does not match the given
  superclass, as well as definitions in ruby level.

* rb_timespec_now() is added to fetch current datetime as struct timespec. [Feature #11558]

* rb_time_timespec_new() is added to create a time object with epoch,
  nanosecond, and UTC/localtime/time offset arguments.  [Feature #11558]

* rb_autoload() deprecated, use rb_funcall() instead.  [Feature #11664]

* rb_compile_error_with_enc(), rb_compile_error(), and rb_compile_bug()
  deprecated.  these functions are exposed but only for internal use.
  external libraries should not use them.

=== Supported platform changes

* OS/2 is no longer supported

* BeOS is no longer supported

* Borland-C is no longer supported

* Haiku now stable and best effort

=== Implementation improvements

* Optimize Proc#call to eliminate method frame construction. [Feature #11569]

* Reconsidering method entry data structure. [Bug #11278]

* Introducing new table data structure for ID keys tables used by
  method table and so on. New table structure is simple and fast
  than st_table. [Feature #11420]

* Machine code level tuning for object allocation and method calling
  code. r52099, r52254

* RubyVM::InstructionSequence is extended for future improvement. [Feature #11788]

* Case dispatch is now optimized for all special constant literals
  including nil, true, and false.  Previously, only literal strings,
  symbols, integers and floats compiled to optimized case dispatch. [Feature #11769]

* Instance variables on non-pure Ruby classes (T_DATA, T_FILE,
  etc..) is less expensive to store than before. [Feature #11170]

* All accesses to members of big Struct objects are performed in
  constant-time.  Previously, Struct elements beyond the first 10
  elements used a linear scan. [Feature #10585]

* The Set class got several speed up. [Misc #10754], [r52591]

* Socket and I/O-related improvements

  * Calling overhead of most of new keyword-using I/O methods in
    [Feature #11229] is reduced by avoiding the inefficient C API
    to parse keywords.  [Feature #11339]

  * The standard library is updated to use the improved
    exception-free non-blocking I/O from [Feature #11229].
    This has the additional benefit of quieter $DEBUG output in
    addition to reducing expensive exceptions. [Feature #11044]

  * (Linux-only) waiting on a single FD anywhere in the stdlib no longer
    uses select(2), making it immune to slowdowns with high-numbered
    FDs. [Feature #11081] [Feature #11377]

* CGI.escapeHTML is optimized with C extension.
