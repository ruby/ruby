: Syntax

  Experimentally altered to get the following code (note the space
  after p):

    p ("xx"*2).to_i

  Interpreted as:

    p (("xx"*2).to_i)

  Instead of:

    (p("xx"*2)).to_i

: Range#to_ary

  Added.  You can now do something like this:

    a, b, c = 1..3

: break and next

  Extended to take an optional expression, which is used as a value
  for termination. [experimental]

: SHA1 module

  ruby-sha1 1.2 is newly imported as a standard library, which shares
  a common interface with the existing md5 module.

: MD5#<<

  Added as an alias for MD5#update.

: to_str

  Added to get objects which define to_str() treated as String's.

  Now almost all the built-in methods try each argument with to_str()
  when they expect it to be a String.

    foo = Object.new
    class <<foo
      def to_str
        "foo"
      end
    end
    p File.open(foo)
    => -:7:in `open': wrong argument type Object (expected String) (TypeError)
       ruby 1.6.4 (2001-04-19) [i586-linux]
    => -:7:in `open': No such file or directory - "foo" (Errno::ENOENT)
       ruby 1.7.0 (2001-05-02) [i586-linux]

: Line-range operation

  Obsoleted except the case when used in a one-liner (ruby -e "..."),
  which means "if 101..200" in a script is no longer interpreted as
  comparison between (({$.})) and 101 or 200.

: Comparison of exception classes in a rescue clause

  Changed to use ((<Module>))#=== for comparing $! with the exception
  class specified in each rescue clause.

  As the previous behavior was to use kind_of?, the effect is limited
  to the SystemCallError case.  SystemCallError.=== has been newly
  defined to return true when the two have the same errno.  With this
  change, SystemCallError's with the same errno, such as Errno::EAGAIN
  and Errno::EWOULDBLOCK, can both be rescued by listing just one of
  them.

: ((<Array>))#fetch

  Added.

: ((<Array>))#insert(n, other, ...)

  Added. ((<ruby-talk:14289>))

  This is much the same as (({ary[n,0] = [other,...]})) except
  returing self.

        ary = [0,1,2,3]
        ary[2, 0] = [4, 5, 6]
        p ary

        ary = [0,1,2,3]
        ary.insert(2, 4, 5, 6)
        p ary

: ((<Array>))#sort!

  Changed to always return self without checking whether the sequence
  of the elements was modified or not.

  Beware that this behavior is not guaranteed to continue in the
  future.  Do not rely on its return value. ((<ruby-dev:12506>))．

: ((<Dir>)).open

  Changed to return what the block returns when a block is given, just
  as ((<File>)).open does. (It always returned (({nil})) in 1.6 and
  prior)

: ((<Dir>)).chdir

  Extended to take a block.

: ((<Dir>)).glob

  Made to support meta-character escaping by a backslash.  Wildcards
  and spaces may now be escaped using a backslash.

: ((<Enumerable>))#all?
: ((<Enumerable>))#any?
: ((<Enumerable>))#inject

  Added.

: ((<File>)).lchmod
: ((<File>)).lchown

  Added.

: ((<IO>)).for_fd

  Added.

: ((<IO>)).read

  Added. ((<ruby-talk:9460>))

: ((<Interrupt>))

  Made a subclass of ((<SignalException>)). (It was a subclass of
  Exception in 1.6 and prior)

: ((<MatchData>))#to_ary

  Added for convenience of Regexp#match. ((<ruby-dev:12766>))

  Previously we had to do:

    foo, bar, baz = /(\w+?)\s+(\w+?)\s+(\w+)/.match("foo bar baz").to_a[1..-1]
    p [foo, bar, baz]

  But now can do:

    _, foo, bar, baz = /(\w+?)\s+(\w+?)\s+(\w+)/.match("foo bar baz")
    p [foo, bar, baz]

: ((<Math>)).acos(x)
: ((<Math>)).asin(x)
: ((<Math>)).atan(x)
: ((<Math>)).cosh(x)
: ((<Math>)).sinh(x)
: ((<Math>)).tanh(x)
: ((<Math>)).hypot(x,y)

  Added.

: ((<Module>))#included

  Added.  This is a hook called after Module#append_feature.

: ((<Module>))#method_removed
: ((<Module>))#method_undefined

  Added.

: ((<NoMethodError>))

  Added. ((<ruby-dev:12763>))

: NotImplementError

  Finally obsoleted.  Use ((<NotImplementedError>)).

: ((<Object>))#singleton_method_removed
: ((<Object>))#singleton_method_undefined

  Added.

: ((<Proc>))#==

  Added.

: ((<Process>)).times

  Moved from ((<Time>)).times. (Time.times still remains but emits a
  warning)

: ((<Process::Status>))

  Added.  (({$?})) is now an instance of this class.

: ((<Process>)).waitall

  Added.

: ((<Regexp>)).last_match(n)

  Extended to take an optional argument.

: ((<Regexp>))#options

  Added.

: ((<String>))#insert(n, other)

  Added.

  This is much the same as (({str[n, 0] = other})) except returing
  self.

: ((<Symbol>)).all_symbols

  Added. ((<ruby-dev:12921>))

: ((<Symbol>))#intern

  Added.

: ((<SystemCallError>)).===

  Added. (See the "Comparison of exception classes in a rescue clause"
  paragraph above) ((<ruby-dev:12670>))

: ((<SystemExit>))#status

  Added.

: ((<TCPSocket>)).new
: ((<TCPSocket>)).open

  Extended to take an address and a port number for the local side in
  optional 3rd and 4th arguments.

: ((<Time>))

  Extended to accept a negative time_t. (Only when the platform
  supports it)

    p Time.at(-1)
    => Thu Jan 01 08:59:59 JST 1970

: ((<Time>))#to_a
: ((<Time>))#zone

  Made to return "UTC" under gmtime.  It used to return a platform
  dependent value, typically "GMT", in 1.6 and prior.
