The Ruby Standard Library is a large collection of classes and modules you can
require in your code to gain additional features.

Below is an overview of the libraries and extensions, followed by a brief description
of each.

## Libraries

- `MakeMakefile`: A module used to generate a Makefile for C extensions

# Default gems

- Default gems are shipped with Ruby releases and also available as rubygems.
- Default gems are not uninstallable from the Ruby installation.
- Default gems can be updated using rubygems.
    - e.g. `gem update json`
- Default gems can be used with bundler environments like `unbundled_env`.
- Default gems can be used at any version in a Gemfile.
