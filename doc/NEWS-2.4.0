    [Feature #12210]

* WEBrick

  * Don't allow , as a separator [Bug #12791]

=== Compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

* Array#sum and Enumerable#sum are implemented.  [Feature #12217]
  Ruby itself has no compatibility problem because Ruby didn't have sum method
  for arrays before Ruby 2.4.
  However many third party gems, activesupport, facets, simple_stats, etc,
  defines sum method.  These implementations are mostly compatible but
  there are subtle differences.
  Ruby's sum method should be mostly compatible but it is impossible to
  be perfectly compatible with all of them.

* Fixnum and Bignum are unified into Integer  [Feature #12005]
  Fixnum class and Bignum class is removed.
  Integer class is changed from abstract class to concrete class.
  For example, 0 is an instance of Integer: 0.class returns Integer.
  The constants Fixnum and Bignum is bound to Integer.
  So obj.kind_of?(Fixnum) works as obj.kind_of?(Integer).
  At C-level, Fixnum object and Bignum object should be distinguished by
  FIXNUM_P(obj) and RB_TYPE_P(obj, T_BIGNUM).
  RUBY_INTEGER_UNIFICATION can be used to detect this feature at C-level.
  0.class == Integer can be used to detect this feature at Ruby-level.
  The C-level constants, rb_cFixnum and rb_cBignum, are removed.
  They can cause compilation failure.

* String/Symbol#upcase/downcase/swapcase/capitalize(!) now work for all of
  Unicode, not only for ASCII. [Feature #10085]
  No change is needed if the data is in ASCII anyway or if the limitation
  to ASCII was only tolerated while waiting for a more extensive implementation.
  A change (using the :ascii option) is needed in cases where Unicode data
  is processed, but the operation has to be limited to ASCII only.
  A good example of this are internationalized domain names.

* TRUE / FALSE / NIL
  These constants are now obsoleted. [Feature #12574]
  Use true / false / nil resp. instead.

=== Stdlib compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

* DateTime

  * DateTime#to_time now preserves timezone.  [Bug #12189]

* PSych

  * Update Psych 2.2.2

* RDoc

  * Update RDoc 5.0.0

* RubyGems

  * Update RubyGems 2.6.8

* shellwords

  * Shellwords.shellwords (shellsplit) treats the backslash as escape
    character only when followed by one of the following characters:
    $ ` " \ <newline>
    [Bug #10055]

* Time

  * Time#to_time now preserves timezone.  [Bug #12271]

* thread

  * the extension library is removed.  Till 2.0 it was a pure ruby script
    "thread.rb", which has precedence over "thread.so", and has been provided
    in $LOADED_FEATURES since 2.1.

* Tk

  * Tk is removed from stdlib.  [Feature #8539]
    https://github.com/ruby/tk is the new upstream.

* XMLRPC

  * XMLRPC is removed from stdlib, and bundled as gem. [Feature #12160][ruby-core:74239]
    https://github.com/ruby/xmlrpc is the new upstream.

* Zlib

  * Zlib.gzip and Zlib.gunzip [Feature #13020]

=== C API updates

* ruby_show_version() will no longer exits the process, if
  RUBY_SHOW_COPYRIGHT_TO_DIE is set to 0.  This will be the default in
  the future.

* rb_gc_adjust_memory_usage() [Feature #12690]

=== Supported platform changes

* FreeBSD < 4 is no longer supported

=== Implementation improvements

* In some condition, `[x, y].max` and `[x, y].min` are optimized
  so that a temporal array is not created.  The concrete condition is
  an implementation detail: currently, the array literal must have no
  splat, must have at least one expression but literal, the length must
  be <= 0x100, and Array#max and min must not be redefined.  It will work
  in most casual and real-life use case where it is written with intent
  to `Math.max(x, y)`.

* Thread deadlock detection now shows their backtrace and dependency. [Feature #8214]

* st_table (st.c) internal data structure is improved. [Feature #12142]

* Rational is extensively optimized. [Feature #12484]

=== Miscellaneous changes

* ChangeLog is removed from the repository.
  It is generated from commit messages in Subversion by `make dist`.
  Also note that now people should follow Git style commit message.
